|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|--|
|First Look|  **Build Less Often**<br>Run Client and Server in your Unity editor simultaneously.<br><br> **Transform Feature Module**<br>Buffer and interpolate position and rotation updates.        |**Automatic synchronisation**<br>Changes to components are synchronised for you by generated code - but you have full control if you want to override this.            | **Harness the power of ECS**<br>Make use of the advantages of the Unity Entity Component System (ECS). 
|Coming Soon   |**Examples game**<br>An example game will both test the GDK and provide a scaled example to speed up development.           |**MonoBehaviour workflow**<br>ECS isn't the right workflow for everything. We will also provide APIs to inject state into MonoBehaviours.            |
|R&D    |**New Feature Modules**<br>We are considering pathfinding, NPC AI, shooting and character controllers. Let us know what you'd like to see! | **Schema auto-generation**<br>We are experimenting with automatically generating schema, based upon the structs and classes you define in C#.<br><br>**Synchronous spawning**<br>Asynchronous spawning on SpatialOS has been a magnet for bugs. We're looking to provide a synchornous API and to handle replication behind the scenes. | **Multithreading**<br>We want to investigate multithreading via the Unity Jobs System. We also want to make using Jobs in game logic as easy as possible. |
