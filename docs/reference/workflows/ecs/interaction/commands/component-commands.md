# ECS: Component commands

 _This document relates to the [ECS workflow]({{urlRoot}}/reference/workflows/overview)._

Before reading this document, make sure you are familiar with:

* [Read and write access]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#authority)

## About commands

Commands are SpatialOS's equivalent of [remote procedure calls (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call). You use commands to send messages between two [workers]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/worker). Commands are relevant to both [MonoBehaviour and ECS workflows]({{urlRoot}}/reference/workflows/overview).<br/>

There are two types of commands in SpatialOS:

* **World commands** are pre-set commands for reserving, creating, deleting and requesting information about [SpatialOS entities]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#spatialos-entity).
* **Component commands** you set up in your [schema]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#schema) for workers to invoke on any SpatialOS entityâ€™s components.

## How to send and receive component commands

The GDK generates the following ECS components to allow you to send and receive commands using the ECS flow:

* `{name of component}.CommandSenders.{name of command}`: allows you to send command requests
* `{name of component}.CommandResponders.{name of command}`: allows you to send command responses
* Command request and response structs

We use the following schema for all examples described in this documentation.
```schemalang
package playground;

component CubeSpawner
{
    id = 12002;
    command improbable.common.Empty spawn_cube(improbable.common.Empty);
}
```

The GDK generates the following types in the `Playground` namespace:

  * `CubeSpawner.SpawnCube.Request`
  * `CubeSpawner.SpawnCube.ReceivedRequest`
  * `CubeSpawner.SpawnCube.Response`
  * `CubeSpawner.SpawnCube.ReceivedResponse`
  * `CubeSpawner.CommandRequests.SpawnCube`
  * `CubeSpawner.CommandResponses.SpawnCube`
  * `CubeSpawner.CommandSenders.SpawnCube`
  * `CubeSpawner.CommandResponders.SpawnCube`

## How to send command requests

The following code snippet provides an example on how to send a command request.
This example ECS system would run on any worker that has this system added to its ECS world.

```csharp
// This ensures all command requests that you want to send are added before the
// SpatialOSSendSystem in which all commands will be sent
[UpdateInGroup(typeof(SpatialOSUpdateGroup))]
public class SendSpawnCubeRequestSystem : ComponentSystem
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public readonly int Length;
        [ReadOnly] public ComponentDataArray<SpatialEntityId> EntityIds;
        // This is a non-SpatialOS ECS component to trigger the spawning
        [ReadOnly] public ComponentDataArray<ShouldSpawnCube> DenotesShouldSpawnCube;
        public ComponentDataArray<CubeSpawner.CommandSenders.SpawnCube> SpawnCubeSenders;
    }

    [Inject] private Data data;

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        for (var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            var requestSender = data.SpawnCubeSenders[i];
            var targetEntityId = data.EntityIds[i];
            // create the request you want to send
            var request = new CubeSpawner.SpawnCube.Request
            (
                targetEntityId,
                new Empty()
            );
            // add it to the list of command requests to be sent at the end of the current update loop
            requestSender.RequestsToSend.Add(request);
            data.SpawnCubeSenders[i] = requestSender;
        }
    }
}
```

## How to handle received command requests

The following code snippet provides an example on how to process and respond to a received command request.
This example ECS system would run only on workers that have this system added to their ECS world and have write access over the corresponding component.

```csharp
// This ensures all command requests that you want to handle are processed before the
// CleanReactiveComponentsSystem cleans them up.
[UpdateInGroup(typeof(SpatialOSUpdateGroup))]
public class HandleSpawnCubeRequestSystem : ComponentSystem
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public readonly int Length;
        public ComponentDataArray<CubeSpawner.CommandRequests.SpawnCube> ReceivedSpawnCubeRequests;
        public ComponentDataArray<CubeSpawner.CommandResponders.SpawnCube> CommandResponders;
    }

    [Inject] private Data data;

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        for(var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            var spawnCubeRequests = data.ReceivedSpawnCubeRequests[i];
            var responder = data.CommandResponders[i];

            foreach (var spawnCubeRequest in requests.Requests)
            {
                // handle each SpawnCube request you received
                // ...
                // create a SpawnCube response
                var spawnCubeResponse = new CubeSpawner.SpawnCube.Response
                (
                    spawnCubeRequest.RequestId,
                    new Empty()
                );

                // add it to the list of command responses to be sent
                // at the end of the current update loop
                responder.ResponsesToSend.Add(spawnCubeResponse);
            }

            data.CommandResponders[i] = responder;
        }
    }
}
```

## How to handle received command responses

The following code snippet provides an example on how to handle a command response.
This example ECS system would run on any worker that has this system added to its ECS world.

```csharp
// This ensures all command responses that you want to handle are processed before the
// CleanReactiveComponentsSystem cleans them up.
[UpdateInGroup(typeof(SpatialOSUpdateGroup))]
public class HandleSpawnCubeResponseSystem : ComponentSystem
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public readonly int Length;
        public ComponentDataArray<CubeSpawner.CommandResponses.SpawnCube> ReceivedSpawnCubeResponses;
    }

    [Inject] private Data data;

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        for (var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            var responses = data.ReceivedSpawnCubeResponses[i];

            foreach (var response in responses.Responses)
            {
                if (response.StatusCode != StatusCode.Success)
                {
                    // Handle command failure
                    continue;
                }

                var responsePayload = response.ResponsePayload;
                var requestPayload = response.RequestPayload;
                // Handle SpawnCube response
            }
        }
    }
}
```
