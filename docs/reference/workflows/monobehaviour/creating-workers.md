# Creating workers
_This document relates to the [MonoBehaviour workflow]({{urlRoot}}/reference/workflows/which-workflow)._

First see the documentation on:

* [Workers in the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/worker)

To demonstrate the use of the [`Worker`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker) class, the GDK contains an example implementation
of how to create a worker instance (server-worker or client-worker) as a [`Worker`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker) object and connect to SpatialOS. We provide an abstract [`WorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker-connector) class and a [`DefaultWorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/default-worker-connector) child class implementing the abstract methods to get you started quickly. You can extend it further by creating classes which inherit from it.

The [`WorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker-connector) is a MonoBehaviour script. You can use it to create multiple server-worker or client-worker instances in one Scene by adding it to multiple GameObjects, each GameObject creating a different worker instance.

**ECS entity translation** <br/>
When you have multiple worker instances represented as GameObjects in a Scene, you are likely to have multiple ECS entities [checked out]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#authority) to each worker instance/GameObject. To make sure you don’t have all the ECS entities which are checked out to a worker instance/GameObject in the same (x, y, z) location, we use an offset for each ECS entity against the origin of the worker instance/GameObject.  We call the offset of the worker instance/GameObject origin, the “translation”.


## How to use worker prefabs

In the GDK’s [Blank project](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-blank-project), we provide an example implementation of a server-worker and client-worker on different platforms connecting using the [`WorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker-connector). There are four example scripts and five example Scenes.

#### Scripts
The scripts are stored inside `workers/unity/Assets/Scripts/Workers`:

* `UnityClientConnector`: This is a sample implementation to connect as a client-worker on Windows or MacOS. (Note that the client-worker is sometimes called `UnityClient`.)
* `UnityGameLogicConnector`: This is a sample implementation to connect as a server-worker.
* `AndroidClientWorkerConnector`: This is a sample implementation to connect as a client-worker on an Android device.
* `iOSClientWorkerConnector`: This is a sample implementation to connect as a client-worker on an iOS device.

#### Scenes

* `ClientScene`: This Scene contains only the `ClientWorker` GameObject which you can use to build a client-worker instance for cloud deployments (for a game client on Windows or MacOS)
* `AndroidClientScene`: This Scene contains only the `AndroidClient` GameObject which you can use to build your client-worker for local and cloud deployments (for a game client on Android).
* `iOSClientScene`: This Scene contains only the `iOSClient` GameObject which you can use to build your client-worker for local and cloud deployments (for a game client on iOS).
* `GameLogicScene`: This Scene contains only the `GameLogicWorker` GameObject which you can use to build a server-worker instance for cloud deployments (as it’s a server-worker instance, the game client platform you are using is irrelevant).
* `DevelopmentScene`: This Scene contains both the `ClientWorker` GameObject representing the client-worker instance and the `GameLogicWorker` GameObject representing the server-worker instance and starts both worker instances as soon as you load the Scene.

## How to create your own WorkerConnector
You can inherit from the [`WorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker-connector) class to create your own connection logic, dependent on the [type of the worker]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#worker-types) that you want to create.

**Example**</br>
Showing what your implementation, inheriting from [`DefaultWorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/default-worker-connector), could look like.

```csharp
public class ClientWorkerConnector : DefaultWorkerConnector
{
    private async void Start()
    {
        // Try to connect as a worker of type UnityClient.
        await Connect("UnityClient", new ForwardingDispatcher()).ConfigureAwait(false);
    }

    protected override string SelectDeploymentName(DeploymentList deployments)
    {
        // Return the name of the first active deployment that you can find.
        return deployments.Deployments[0].DeploymentName;
    }

    protected override void HandleWorkerConnectionEstablished()
    {
        // Add all the systems that you want on your workers.
        Worker.World.GetOrCreateManager<YourSystem>();
    }

    protected override void HandleWorkerConnectionFailure()
    {
        Debug.Log("Failed to create worker.");
    }

    public override void Dispose()
    {
        // Need to call base.Dispose() to properly clean up.
        // The ECS world and the connection.
        base.Dispose();
    }
}
```

## How to modify the connection configuration

When inheriting from the [`WorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker-connector), you can override `GetAlphaLocatorConfig`, `GetLocatorConfig` and
`GetReceptionistConfig` to modify the connection configuration a worker type uses to connect to the
Locator or Receptionist. See [Connecting to SpatialOS]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/connection-flows) to find out more about the connection flows for client-workers and server-workers.

**Example** </br>
Overriding the Receptionist connection flow configuration.

```csharp
protected override ReceptionistConfig GetReceptionistConfig(string workerType)
{
    return new ReceptionistConfig
    {
        WorkerType = workerType,
        WorkerId = CreateNewWorkerId(workerType),
        UseExternalIp = UseExternalIp
    };
}
```

## How to decide which connect service to use
First, see [Connecting to SpatialOS]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/connection-flows) to find out more about the connection flows for client-workers and server-workers).

The [`WorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/worker-connector) provides a default implementation which automatically decides which connection flow to use based on whether the application is running in your Unity Editor and whether it can find a login token. You can change the behavior by overriding the `GetConnectionService` method.

**Example** </br>
Overriding which connection service to choose.

```csharp
protected override ConnectionService GetConnectionService()
{
    // Your worker will always connect via the Receptionist.
    // This is the expected behavior for any server-worker.
    return ConnectionService.Receptionist;
}
```

## How to connect using the development authentication flow
We provide an integration with the [development authentication flow](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/auth/development-authentication#developmentauthenticationtoken-maintenance) that you can use to connect your client-workers to a cloud deployment. This is especially important when working with [client-workers for mobile devices]({{urlRoot}}/reference/mobile/overview).

The [`MobileWorkerConnector`]({{urlRoot}}/api/mobile/mobile-worker-connector) already provides an implementation to use the development authentication flow connecting via the [new v13.5+ Locator connection flow]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/connection-flows#locator-connection-flow).

However, you can use the development authentification but override using the new Locator, using the example code below.

**Example** </br>
How to override use the development authentication flow without using the new v13.5+ Locator connection flow configuration.

```csharp
protected override AlphaLocatorConfig GetAlphaLocatorConfig(string workerType)
{
    var pit = GetDevelopmentPlayerIdentityToken(DevelopmentAuthToken, GetPlayerId(), GetDisplayName());
    var loginTokenDetails = GetDevelopmentLoginTokens(workerType, pit);
    var loginToken = SelectLoginToken(loginTokenDetails);

    return new AlphaLocatorConfig
    {
        LocatorHost = RuntimeConfigDefaults.LocatorHost,
        LocatorParameters = new Worker.CInterop.Alpha.LocatorParameters
        {
            PlayerIdentity = new PlayerIdentityCredentials
            {
                PlayerIdentityToken  = pit,
                LoginToken = loginToken,
            },
            UseInsecureConnection = false,
        }
    };
}
```
