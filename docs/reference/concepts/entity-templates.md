# Entity templates

<%(Callout message="
Before reading this document, make sure you are familiar with:

  * [Workers in the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/worker)
  * [Standard schema library components](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/<%(Var key="worker_sdk_version")%>/shared/glossary#standard-schema-library-components)
")%>

An [`EntityTemplate`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/entity-template) specifies what [components]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#spatialos-component) a [SpatialOS entity]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#spatialos-entity) contains, the initial values of these components and which [layers](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/<%(Var key="worker_sdk_version")%>/shared/glossary#layers) get [write access]({{urlRoot}}/reference//glossary#authority) to each component.

## How to define an entity template

To define an entity template, you must first construct an `EntityTemplate`.

```csharp
var entityTemplate = new EntityTemplate();
```

An `EntityTemplate` can be mutated and used multiple times.

### Add components to entity template

All SpatialOS entities require the `Position` and `EntityAcl` components.

The `Position` component must be added to the entity template manually. It is used by SpatialOS for [load-balancing](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/<%(Var key="worker_sdk_version")%>/shared/worker-configuration/load-balancing) purposes and [relative constraints in query-based interest](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/<%(Var key="worker_sdk_version")%>/shared/authority-and-interest/interest/query-based-interest-qbi#constraints).

The `EntityAcl` component is automatically handled by the [`EntityTemplate`]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/entity-template) class. This component determines which types of workers have read access to an entity and, for each component, which type of worker can have write access. Note that at any point in time, only instance of a worker can be authoritative over an entity's component.

> To learn more about the standard schema library components, [go to this documentation](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/<%(Var key="worker_sdk_version")%>/shared/glossary#standard-schema-library-components).

To add components to the entity template and specify which worker type has write access over the component, use the `AddComponent` method.

```csharp
// Adds the Position component to the template and specifies that
// only a UnityGameLogic worker can have write access
entityTemplate.AddComponent(new Position.Snapshot(coords), "UnityGameLogic");
```

The `AddComponent` method updates the write access attribute for the given component in the `EntityAcl`.

### Set read access

To ensure that interested workers can read the components and values of an entity, the read access must be set in the `EntityAcl` component.

This is done by calling the `SetReadAccess` method.

```csharp
// Ensures that any UnityGameLogic and UnityClient worker can read all components on an entity
entityTemplate.SetReadAccess("UnityGameLogic", "UnityClient");
```

## Advanced usage

In addition to adding components and setting read access, the `EntityTemplate` class provides other utility methods for:

* getting, overriding or removing component snapshots from the template
* getting or overriding component write access attributes for a given component in the template
* creating an `Entity` instance from the template

You can find more information about these methods in the [API reference documentation]({{urlRoot}}/api/core/entity-template#entitytemplate-class).
