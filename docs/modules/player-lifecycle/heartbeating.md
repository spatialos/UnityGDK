# Heartbeating

Heartbeating is how a server-worker continually checks that a client-worker has not disconnected from SpatialOS.

The server-worker sends a `PlayerHeartbeat` request at regular intervals. If the server-worker doesnâ€™t receive any responses back from a client-worker within a given period of time, the server-worker will assume the client has died. The server-worker then proceeds to delete the Player entity associated with that client-worker.

## How does it work in the GDK?
