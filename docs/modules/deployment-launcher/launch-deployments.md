# Launch deployments

Open the Deployment Launcher window by selecting **SpatialOS** > **Deployment Launcher** from the Unity Editor menu.

## UI walkthrough

The section of the Deployment Launcher window that you use to launch deployments can be found under the **Deployment Configurations** label.

### Deployment configuration

A deployment configuration is used to describe what parameters a deployment should be launched with.

<img src="{{assetRoot}}assets/modules/deployment-launcher/dpl-configs.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: auto; display: block;" />

<%(#Expandable title="Fields")%>

| Field | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assembly Name | ✔️ | The identifier of an assembly you have uploaded. |
| Deployment Name | ✔️ | The name you wish to give to the deployment. |
| Snapshot Path | ❌ | Path to the [snapshot](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#snapshot) you wish to start the deployment with, relative from the root of your SpatialOS project. |
| Launch Config | ✔️ | Path to the launch configuration you wish to start the deployment with, relative from the root of your SpatialOS project. |
| Region | ✔️ | The geographical location in which your deployment launches. |
| Tags | ❌ | Metadata that can be added to a deployment. Some tags have built-in functionality. For example, the `dev_login` tag is used to connect into deployment through the [development authentication flow](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/auth/development-authentication). |
| Simulated Player Deployments | ❌ | A set of child deployments responsible for running simulated players that connect into the parent deployment. These deployments are launched after the parent deployment has successfully started. |

<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="Buttons")%>

| Button name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Add new deployment configuration | When pressed, this creates a new deployment configuration. |
| Add simulated player deployment | When pressed, this creates a new simulated player deployment configuration as a child of a parent deployment. |
| Remove (➖) | When pressed, this removes a deployment from the list of configurations. |

<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(Callout message="

The remove button (➖) is used to either:

* Remove a full deployment configuration.
* Remove a simulated player deployment from its parent deployment configuration.

![]({{assetRoot}}assets/modules/deployment-launcher/remove-simplayer-dpl-config.png)

")%>

### Simulated player deployment configuration

Simulated player deployments inherit the following fields from their parent deployment:

* Assembly name
* Region

<img src="{{assetRoot}}assets/modules/deployment-launcher/dpl-configs-sim.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: auto; display: block;" />

In addition, each simulated player deployment is assigned a deployment name based on its parent. For example, given a `parent_deployment_name`, a simulated player deployment is given a name of the format:

```text
{parent_deployment_name}_sim{N}

Where N is in range [1, number of simulated player deployments]
```

<%(#Expandable title="Additional fields")%>

| Field | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snapshot Path | ❌ | Path to the [snapshot](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#snapshot) you wish to start the deployment with, relative from the root of your SpatialOS project. |
| Launch Config | ✔️ | Path to the launch configuration you wish to start the deployment with, relative from the root of your SpatialOS project. |
| Region | ✔️ | The geographical location in which your deployment launches. |
| Tags | ❌ | Metadata that can be added to a deployment. Some tags have built-in functionality. For example, the `dev_login` tag is used to connect into deployment through the [development authentication flow](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/auth/development-authentication). |
| Flag Prefix | ✔️ | The prefix to include on worker flags that the Deployment Launcher adds to simulated player deployments. This should follow [worker flag naming conventions](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/worker-configuration/worker-flags#naming-conventions). |
| Worker Type | ✔️ | The worker type of the simulated player coordinator, responsible for managing simulated players in the child deployment and connecting them to the parent deployment. |

### Launch deployments

At the bottom of the deployment configurations panel, there is a **Launch deployment** button. You can select which which deployment configuration you wish to launch and then select **Launch deployment**.

## Expected behaviour

### Input validation

The deployment launcher validates your deployment configurations as you edit them in the Unity Editor. If any field fails validation, errors similar to those highlighted below are shown and the **Launch deployment** button is disabled until you resolve all the errors.

#### Assembly name

Your assembly name:

* Must contain at least 5 characters.
* Must contain at most 64 characters.
* Can contain alphanumeric characters.
* Can contain the following special characters: `_`, `.`, and `-`.

If validation fails, an error similar to below is shown:

```text
Assembly Name "<invalid_name>" is invalid. Must conform to the regex: ^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{5,64}
```

#### Deployment name

Your deployment name:

* Must contain at least 2 characters.
* Must contain at most 32 characters.
* Must be in lowercase.
* Can contain alphanumeric characters.
* Can contain underscores.

If validation fails, an error similar to below is shown:

```text
Deployment Name "<invalid_name>" is invalid. Must conform to the regex: ^[a-z0-9_]{2,32}$
```

#### Snapshot path

If a snapshot does not exist at the file path you have specified, an error similar to below is shown:

```text
Snapshot file at "<snapshot_path>" cannot be found.
```

#### Launch config

If your launch configuration is an empty file or does not exist at the specified file path, you will see an error similar to one of the below:

```text
Launch Config cannot be empty.
```

```text
Launch Config file at {filePath} cannot be found.
```

#### Region

At present, you can select either `EU` or `US` as the region to launch your deployment in.

#### Tags

Each tag:

* Must begin with an alphanumeric character.
* Must contain at least 2 characters.
* Must contain at most 32 characters.
* Can contain underscores after the first character.

If validation fails, an error similar to below is shown:

```text
Tag "<tag>" invalid. Must conform to the regex: ^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_]{2,32}$
```

#### Flag prefix

A flag prefix is not allowed to be empty and cannot contain full stops or spaces.

If validation fails, an error similar to below is shown:

```text
Flag Prefix cannot be empty.

Flag Prefix cannot contain full stops.

Flag Prefix cannot contain spaces.
```

#### Worker Type

The simulated player coordinator worker type can be chosen from a drop-down list of workers in the project.

### Launching a deployment

When you press the **Launch deployment** button, the Deployment Launcher starts launching the deployments specified in the configuration chosen in the adjacent drop-down menu.

<img src="{{assetRoot}}assets/modules/deployment-launcher/choose-launch-config.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: auto; display: block;" />

For each deployment launched, you should see a notification similar to the following at the bottom of the deployment launcher window:

```text
Launching deployment "<deployment_name>" in project "<project_name>".
Assembly reloading locked.
```

<%(Callout message="
When a deployment successfully launches:

* The [Console](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#console) page for the deployment automatically opens in your browser.
* The notification at the bottom of the Deployment Launcher window disappears.
")%>

<%(#Expandable title="Cancel the deployment launching operation")%>

When a deployment is being launched, you can cancel the operation by pressing the **Cancel** button shown next to the notification at the bottom of your Deployment Launcher window.

<%(Callout type="warn" message="
Cancelling the operation does not prevent the deployment from launching, and may result in a new deployment starting with an unknown state.
")%>
