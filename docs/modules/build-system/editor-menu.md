# Editor menu

The Build System Feature Module also provides a set of Unity Editor menu items to build your workers from your Unity Editor. These can be accessed via the **SpatialOS** menu item. 

You can build for a specific target: **Build for local** and **Build for cloud** and then by specific worker type, or build all workers.

For example, to build `UnityClient` for a cloud deployment you would select **SpatialOS** > **Build for cloud** > **UnityClient**.
