# Set up iOS support

> **Note:** iOS development is only supported on macOS.

## 1. Install the build dependencies

The build dependencies for developing for iOS can be installed directly through the Unity Hub.

### I have an existing Unity installation

1. Open the Unity Hub.
1. Select **Installs**.
1. Find the Editor you want to add iOS build support to.
1. Select the three dots to the right of the version label, then select **Add Modules**.
1. In the **Add Modules** dialog, locate the **iOS Build Support** module and tick its checkbox.
1. When you have selected all the modules to add, select **Done**.

> **Note:** If you didnâ€™t install the Editor via the Hub, you will not see the option to **Add Modules**. To enable this option, install the Editor via the Hub.

### I don't have an existing Unity installation

Please follow the steps in [Setup & installation]({{urlRoot}}/machine-setup) and additionally select the **iOS Build Support** module when installing Unity.

## 2. Install Xcode and the command line tools

Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) through the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

Once Xcode is installed, download and install the Command Line Tools for Xcode via the [download archive](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode).

## 3. Prepare your physical device

If you want to launch your game on a physical device, you need to:

1. Connect your iOS device to your computer using a USB cable. Accept the **Trust This Computer** alert if it appears.
1. If you want to connect your device to a local deployment, ensure your computer and your mobile device are connected to the same network.

## 4. Set up your Unity Editor

Most of your interactions with the GDK happen inside your Unity Editor. To get started:

1. Open your project inside your Unity Editor.
1. In your Unity Editor, select **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player**. This opens the **Project Settings** window.
1. In the Inspector window, select **Settings for iOS (the iPhone icon)** > **Other Settings**.
1. In the **Configuration** section of the Inspector window, locate **Target SDK** and select:
    * **Device SDK**, if you want to run your application on a physical device.
    * **Simulator SDK**, if you want to run your application on an iOS Simulator.
1. (Optional, if you want to use Unity Remote) Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Editor** to bring up the **Editor Settings** window and navigate to the **Unity Remote** section. Set the **Device** setting to **Any iOS Device**.

## (Optional) Set up Unity Remote

Unity Remote is Unity's solution for faster mobile development iteration times. Check out [Unity's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html) for more information and setup instructions.
