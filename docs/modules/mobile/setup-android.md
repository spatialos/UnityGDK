### I have an existing Unity installation

1. Open the Unity Hub.
1. Select **Installs**.
1. Find the Editor you want to add Android build support to.
1. Select the three dots to the right of the version label, then select **Add Modules**.
1. In the Add Modules dialog, locate the **Android Build Support**, **Android SDK & NDK tools**, and **Open JDK** modules and tick its checkbox.
1. When you have selected all the modules to add, select **Done**.

> **Note:** If you didnâ€™t install the Editor via the Hub, you will not see the option to **Add Modules**. To enable this option, install the Editor via the Hub.

### I don't have an existing Unity installation

Please follow the steps in [Setup & installation]({{urlRoot}}/machine-setup) and additionally select the **Android Build Support**, **Android SDK & NDK tools**, and **Open JDK** modules when installing Unity.

## 2. Prepare your physical device

If you want to launch your game on a physical device, you need to:

1. Ensure you have USB debugging enabled on it. See the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) for guidance.
1. Connect the mobile device to your computer using a USB cable. You might get a pop-up window on the device asking you to allow USB debugging. Select **Yes**.
1. If you want to connect your device to a local deployment, ensure your computer and your mobile device are connected to the same network.

## (Optional) Set up an emulator

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/). At the **Choose Components** stage of the installation, be sure to select **Android Virtual Device**.
1. Create an Android emulator by going to **Tools** > **AVD Manager** > **Create Virtual Device**. Ensure you choose the same CPU architecture for your virtual machine as your development machine to get the best performance.

## (Optional) Set up Unity Remote

Unity Remote is Unity's solution for faster mobile development iteration times. Check out [Unity's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html) for more information and setup instructions.
