# How the Transform Synchronization Feature Module works

## What is transform

The transform of an entity describes its location and rotation. Worker-instances generally use it to run physics simulations or render entities for a client. Note that the SpatialOS representation of transform is _not_ the same as Unity's representation of transform.

In the Transform Synchronization Feature Module, we represent the Transform as:

```schemalang
package improbable.gdk.transform_synchronization;

type FixedPointVector3 {
    sint32 x = 1;
    sint32 y = 2;
    sint32 z = 3;
}

type CompressedQuaternion {
    uint32 data = 1;
}

component TransformInternal {
    id = 11000;
    FixedPointVector3 location = 1;
    CompressedQuaternion rotation = 2;
    FixedPointVector3 velocity = 3;
    uint32 physics_tick = 4;
    float ticks_per_second = 5;
}
```

> **Note:** The `TransformInternal` component contains additional fields such as `velocity` and `physics_tick`. These are implementation details of the Transform Synchronization Feature Module.

1. **Separation of responsibilies.** The `Improbable.Position` component is the load balancer's representation of location and the `TransformInternal` component is the workers' representation of location. This allows you to abstract the concept of location from the load balancer. A gameplay programmer would only need to be aware of the Unity `Transform` without having to know about the load balancer at all.
1. **Save bandwidth.** The `TransformInternal` component contains the compressed representations of location, rotation and velocity. By comparison, a `Position` uses 3 doubles representing the raw location of an entity. If the `TransformInternal` component has a high frequency update rate and the `Position` component has a low frequency update rate, you have a net bandwidth saving compared to updating just the `Position` component at a high frequency!
1. **Atomicity.** The `TransformInternal` component contains more than just the location. If the other fields were on a separate component, you lose the guarantee that all fields are updated atomically. Two updates sent in the same frame from one worker are _not_ guaranteed to be received in the same frame on another.

## How `TransformInternal` is compressed

##### Location

Although the Improbable `Position` component uses 3 doubles, a Unity transform represents location as three floats. This makes the double-precision of `Position` redundant, and location can be represented with 96 bits instead of 192.

To further optimise this, the `FixedPointVector3` type is introduced to represent a location as three [Q21.10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(number_format)) _fixed-point_ values. This type represents each of its components as variable-length zig-zag encoded integers, so that smaller _absolute_ values use fewer bits.

With the Q21.10 format, each fixed point value is within the range -2097152 to 2097151.999 at a precision of 0.0009765625 (2^-10). By encoding as a `FixedPointVector3`, location requires _at most_ 96 bits instead of _always_ requiring 96 bits.

##### Rotation

The rotation of a transform is compressed from four floats to a single 32 bit unsigned integer, using the "smallest three" trick. As a quaternion's length must equal 1, the largest component can be dropped and recalculated later from the values of the other components. By storing the smallest three components at a lower precision, an entire quaternion can fit into 32 bits.

The `CompressedQuaternion` schema type utilises 2 bits to define the index of the largest component and 10 bits to encode each quaternion element, which translates to a mean precision in Euler angles of 0.08 degrees.

## How do my entities' transform get synchronized

The behaviour of the Transform Synchronization Feature Modules differs depending on whether your worker-instance is authoritative over the `TransformInternal` _and_ `Position` components. This behaviour can be adjusted with [transform synchronization strategies]({{urlRoot}}/modules/transform-sync/strategies), but broadly goes as follows:

##### On authoritative worker-instances

The Transform Synchronization Feature Module listens for changes in the native Unity transform representation (`UnityEngine.Transform` or `UnityEngine.Rigidbody`) and translates these into `TransformInternal` and `Position` component updates.

This means that, as a user, you shouldn't manually update the `TransformInternal` or `Position` components. You can simply move your GameObjects as you normally would and these changes will be synchronized as specified in the applied strategy.

##### On non-authoritative worker-instances

The Transform Synchronization Feature Module listens for SpatialOS component updates in the `TransformInternal` component and applies these changes to the native Unity transform representation (`UnityEngine.Transform` or `UnityEngine.Rigidbody`) as specified in the applied strategy.
