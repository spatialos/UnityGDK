  1. Install Android prerequisites:
    * [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) -  Once installed, open Android Studio. Ensure to install:
       * The Android SDK
       * The Android Studio emulator
    * [Android NDK r13b](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases) - Extract it to a directory of your choice. Note down this directory path as you will be needing it in the following steps.
    * [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  * (Optional) [Unity Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unity3d.genericremote) - this is Unityâ€™s solution for faster development iteration times.

## Set up your Unity Editor
After installing these dependencies, open the Unity project in `<path-to-your-project>/workers/unity`.

  1. In the Unity Editor, go to **File** > **Build Settings**. Select **Android** and then click on **Switch Platform**.
