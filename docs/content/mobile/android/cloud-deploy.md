# Connect to a cloud deployment

Before reading this document, make sure you are familiar with:

* [Setting up Android Support for the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/content/mobile/android/setup)
* [Ways to test your Android client]({{urlRoot}}/content/mobile/android/ways-to-test)
* [Development authentication flow](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/auth/development-authentication)
* [Creating workers with WorkerConnector](https://docs.improbable.io/unity/alpha/content/gameobject/creating-workers-with-workerconnector)

To connect your mobile application to a cloud deployment, you need to authenticate against our services.
This guide describes how to authenticate using the development authentication flow which we provide for the early stages of game development.
Altenatively, if you want to create your own authentication server, follow [this guide](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/auth/integrate-authentication-platform-sdk).

## Connecting your Android device or emulator to a cloud deployment

1. Enable USB debugging on your mobile device. See the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) for guidance.
1. [Start your Android Emulator in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) or connect your Android device to your development computer.

    > If you start an emulator, ensure you choose the same CPU architecture for your virtual machine as your development computer. Using a different architecture might affect the performance of your emulator.

1. [Build your server-worker types.]({{urlRoot}}/content/build)
1. Upload your server-worker types. To do this, open a terminal window and from the root directory of your SpatialOS project, enter `spatial cloud upload <assembly name>`.
1. In the same directory, start your cloud deployment using `spatial cloud launch --snapshot=snapshots/default.snapshot my_assembly <launch configuration>.json <deployment name>`.
1. In the SpatialOS Console, tag your cloud deployment with the tag `dev_login`. <BR/>
To do this:
  *  From the [SpatialOS Console](https://console.improbable.io/projects), select your deployment name to display the project **OVERVIEW** screen.
  * In the **OVERVIEW** screen, there’s a **Tag** field, add `dev_login` to the field.
1. [Create a Development Authentication Token (SpatialOS documentation).](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/auth/development-authentication#developmentauthenticationtoken-maintenance)
1. Create a MonoBehaviour script which inherits from the [`MobileWorkerConnector`](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity/blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.mobile/Worker/MobileWorkerConnector.cs) and includes the functionality you want. In your Unity Editor, add this script it to your Android client-worker GameObject.
1. The `MobileWorkerConnector` provides a `DevelopmentAuthToken` field. Still in your Unity Editor, make sure your Android client-worker GameObject is selected and in the Inspector, locate the script you just added to it. 
1. In the Inspector, in the script’s drop-down window, there is a field to add the authentication token that you created. 
1. In the same drop-down window, ensure that the checkbox `ShouldConnectLocally` is not checked.
1. In your Unity Editor, navigate to **SpatialOS** > **Build for cloud**. Select your Android client-worker, and wait for the build to complete. <br/>
You know it’s complete when it says `Completed build for Cloud target` in your Unity Editor’s Console window.
1. Select **SpatialOS** > **Launch mobile client** > **Android Device**.
1. Play the game on your Android device or emulator.
