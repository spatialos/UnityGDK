# Mobile Support Overview

Before starting with mobile development, make sure you are familiar with

  * [The SpatialOS GDK for Unity]({{urlRoot}}/content/intro-reference)
  * [The different workflows]({{urlRoot}}/content/intro-workflows-spatialos-entities)
  * [Workers in the GDK]({{urlRoot}}/content/workers/workers-in-the-gdk)

## Developing SpatialOS games for Android and iOS

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity contains a [mobile feature module]({{urlRoot}}/content/modules/core-and-feature-module-overview#mobile-support-module) which enables you to develop games for Android and iOS. All feature modules work with mobile devices.

Because your [SpatialOS World](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#spatialos-world), the canonical source of truth about your game, is distinct from the view of that world that your client-workers visualise, you can create cross-platform multiplayer games with ease.
