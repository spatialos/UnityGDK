# Set up

There are four parts to this step:

1. Sign up for a SpatialOS account (or make sure you are logged in)
2. Set up your machine
3. Get the GDK and the FPS Starter Project source code
4. Open the FPS Starter Project in your Unity Editor

(This page is the longest of the get started guide - the others are much quicker.)

<br/>

### 1. Sign up or log in 

If you have not signed up before, you can do this [here](https://improbable.io/get-spatialos).
<br/>

If you have already signed up, make sure you are logged into [Improbable.io](https://improbable.io). If you are logged in, you should see your picture in the top right of this page; if you are not logged in, select __Sign in__ at the top of this page and follow the instructions.

<br/>

### 2. Set up your machine

<%(#Expandable title="Setup for Windows")%>

**Step 1.** Install **Unity 2018.3.5**

Ensure you install this exact version as other Unity versions may not work with the GDK.

You can download **<a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive" data-track-link="Unity Download Link Clicked|product=Docs|platform=Win|label=Win" target="_blank"><strong>Unity 2018.3.5</strong></a>** from the Unity download archive.

Make sure you download the **Installer** version, and refer to the matrix below for which options to install :

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Option** | **Required?** | **Why?** |
| Linux Build Support | **Yes** | All server-workers in a cloud deployment run in a Linux environment. |
| Mac Build Support | No |  Only required if you wish to build clients compatible with MacOS. |
| Android Build Support | No | Only required if you wish to build mobile clients for Android. |
| iOS Build Support | No | Only required if you wish to build mobile clients for iOS. |

**Step 2.** Install **<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1" data-track-link=".NET Core Download Link Clicked|product=Docs|platform=Win|label=Win" target="_blank"><strong>.NET Core SDK (x64)</strong></a>**

- Verified with versions `2.1.3xx` and `2.1.4xx`

> **Note:** After installing the .NET Core SDK, you should restart any Unity and Unity Hub processes. This will prevent errors where Unity cannot find the `dotnet` executable.

**Step 3.** Run the **<a href="https://console.improbable.io/installer/download/stable/latest/win" data-track-link="SpatialOS Installer Downloaded|product=Docs|platform=Win|label=Win" target="_blank">SpatialOS Installer</a>**

- This installs the [SpatialOS CLI]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#spatial-command-line-tool-cli) , the [SpatialOS Launcher]({{urlRoot}}/content/glossary#launcher), and 32-bit and 64-bit Visual C++ Redistributables

**Step 4.** Install a **code editor** if you don't have one already

- We recommend either [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). See _**Code editor set up**_, below.

**Step 5.** Install Git

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity source code is hosted on GitHub. You need to download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) in order to clone the GDK repositories. 

> If you do not want to use Git you can also download a .zip file containing the GDK repo from the [GDK GitHub Page](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity). However, you will not be able to easily download updates to the GDK if you do not use Git to clone the repository. 

**Step 6.** Restart your machine.

> If you do not restart your machine, you may experience errors when opening a GDK project.

#### Code editor set up

 **Using Visual Studio?**

You need to install the **.NET Core cross-platform development** and **Game development with Unity** workloads. To to this:

- As you install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/), select the **Workloads** tab in the Installer. If you already have Visual Studio installed, you can find the **Workloads** tab by opening Visual Studio Installer and, in the **Products** section, selecting **Modify** for Visual Studio 2017. If you can't see the **Modify** option, select **More**.

![Click Modify to find the Workloads tab.]({{assetRoot}}assets/setup/windows/visualstudioworkloads.png)

Once you have navigated to the **Workloads** tab:

- Select **.NET Core cross-platform development**.
- Select **Game development with Unity**:
  - Deselect any options in the **Summary** on the right that mention a Unity Editor (for example, Unity 2017.2 64-bit Editor or Unity 2018.1 64-bit Editor).
  - The SpatialOS GDK for Unity requires **Unity 2018.3.5**, which you already installed in step 1.
  - Make sure **Visual Studio Tools for Unity** is included (there should be a tick next to it).

> **Warning**: Older versions of Visual Studio 2017 have been known to cause some issues with Unity 2018.3.5 - the issues are projects loading and unloading frequently, and Intellisense breaking. If you do experience these issues, try updating to the latest version of Visual Studio 2017.

**Using Rider?**

Once you have installed [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), install the [**Unity Support** plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity) for a better experience.

### 3. Get the GDK and the FPS Starter Project source code

To run the GDK and the FPS Starter Project, you need to download the source code. There are two ways you can do this: _either_ get both sets of source code as one zip file download _or_ clone the two repositories separately using Git. (To find out more about Git, see [github.io](https://try.github.io)).

<%(Callout message="We recommend using Git, as Git's version control makes it easier for you to get updates in the future.")%>

<%(#Expandable title="Zip file donwload")%>

 While we recommend using Git, if you prefer to, you can get the source code for both the GDK and FPS Starter Project by downloading one zip file <a href="https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project/releases" data-track-link="Starter Project Zip Clicked|product=Docs" target="_blank">here</a>. Please download the latest release, the file should be called something like `gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project-x.y.z.zip`.

<%(Callout message="If you have downloaded the source code via a zip file move on to the next section of this page: [Open the FPS Starter Project in your Unity Editor](#4-open-the-fps-starter-project-in-your-unity-editor).")%>

<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="Clone the two repositories using Git")%>

If you haven't downloaded the zip file, you need to clone two repositories; the FPS Starter Project and the GDK for Unity.

###### Clone the FPS Starter Project repository

Clone the FPS Starter Project using one of the following commands:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| HTTPS | `git clone https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project.git` |
| SSH | `git clone git@github.com:spatialos/gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project.git` |

> You can only clone via SSH if you have already [set up SSH keys (GitHub)](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) with your GitHub account.

###### Clone the GDK for Unity repository

You can use scripts to automatically do this or follow manual instructions.

**Scripts**<br/>
From the root of the `gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project` repository:

  - If you are using Windows run: `powershell scripts/powershell/setup.ps1`
  - If you are using Mac run: `bash scripts/shell/setup.sh`

<br/>

**Manual Instructions**<br/>

Clone the [GDK for Unity](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity) repository alongside the FPS Starter Project so that they sit side-by-side:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| HTTPS | `git clone https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity.git` |
| SSH | `git clone git@github.com:spatialos/gdk-for-unity.git` |

The two repositories should share a common parent, like the example below:

```text
  <common_parent_directory>
      ├── gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project
      ├── gdk-for-unity
```

<%(/Expandable)%>

<br/>

### 4. Open the FPS Starter Project in your Unity Editor

Launch your Unity Editor. It should automatically detect the project but if it doesn't, select **Open** and then select `gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project/workers/unity`.

>**TIP:** The first time you open the Starter Project in your Unity Editor, It takes about 10 minutes; it's much quicker to open after this. (While you are waiting, you could look at our [Games Blog](https://improbable.io/games/blog).)
