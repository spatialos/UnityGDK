# Core Module and Feature Modules overview
_This document relates to both [GameObject-MonoBehaviour and ECS workflows](../intro-workflows-spos-entities.md)._

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity consists of several modules: the Core Module and multiple Feature Modules. The Core Module provides the functionality to enable your game for SpatialOS, while Feature Modules provide functionality that is not needed to connect to the SpatialOS [Runtime](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#the-runtime) but makes it easier to implement your game; such as player lifecycle or transform synchronization. Each module has helper functions which you can use to add the moduleâ€™s functionality to a [worker](https://github.com/spatialos/UnityGDK/blob/master/docs/content/workers.md).

See the documentation on [Workers in the GDK](../workers/workers-in-the-gdk.md) for information on the relationship between workers and [ECS entities](../glossary.md#ecs-entities).

## Core Module

The Core Module contains multiple packages (or "assemblies") that you need to use to set up your Unity-developed game to work with SpatialOS. The packages are:

* `Improbable.Gdk.Core` <br/>
This provides the basic implementation to use SpatialOS natively in Unity.

* `Improbable.Gdk.Tools`<br/>
 This contains the [Code Generator](../code-generator.md) which generates C# code from your schema file and the tools to download dependent SpatialOS packages. (See the SpatialOS documentation on [schema](../glossary.md#schema).)

* `Improbable.Gdk.TestUtils` <br/>
This provides both a testing framework, which you can use to test any other module and a test which you can use to validate the state of the overall project.

## Feature Modules

### Build system module

The `Improbable.Gdk.BuildSystem` module provides an example implementation of how to build your workers. It creates a menu item in the Unity Editor toolbar (menu: **SpatialOS** > **Build...** ) that you can use to easily [build your workers](../build.md#building-your-workers). It also generates a [ScriptableObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html)[ (Unity documentation)](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html) that contains the build configuration for each worker.  This functionality is only available from the Unity Editor.

### Player lifecycle module

To access this module, use the   `Improbable.Gdk.PlayerLifecycle` namespace. It contains members which you use to implement player spawning and player heartbeats. 

`Improbable.Gdk.PlayerLifecycle` is in the repository [here](../../../tree/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.playerlifecycle).

The module consists of:

* `PlayerLifecycleHelper.AddClientSystems(world)` -  in the repository [here](../../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.playerlifecycle/PlayerLifecycleHelper.cs).<br/>
Call this to implement the player lifecycle module, adding all the necessary client systems to your client-worker.<br/>
Call this when you create your [worker](./workers/workers-in-the-gdk.md)**.

* `PlayerLifecycleHelper.AddServerSystems(world)` -  in the repository [here](../../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.playerlifecycle/PlayerLifecycleHelper.cs).<br/>
Call this to implement the player lifecycle module, adding all the necessary server systems to your server-worker.<br/>
Call this when you create your [worker](../workers/workers-in-the-gdk.md).

* `EntityBuilder.AddPlayerLifecycleComponents(clientAccess, serverAccess)` - in the repository [here](../../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.playerlifecycle/PlayerLifecycleHelper.cs).<br/>
Call this to add the SpatialOS components used by the player lifecycle module to your entity.<br/>
Call this during [entity templates creation](../entity-templates.md). See an [example use](../entity-templae-creation.md#player-lifecycle-module) in the *Entity template creation* documentation.

### Transform synchronization module

To access this module, use the `Improbable.Gdk.TransformSynchronization` namespace. It is a basic implementation of synchronizing the position and rotation of SpatialOS entities between client-workers and server-workers.

`Improbable.Gdk.TransformSynchronization` is in the repository [here](../../../tree/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.transformsynchronization).

This module consists of:

* `TransformSynchronizationHelper.AddSystems(world)` is in the repository [here](../../../tree/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.transformsynchronization).<br/>
Call this to implement the transform synchronization module, adding all the necessary systems to all workers.

* `EntityBuilder.AddTransformSynchronizationComponents(writeAccess, location = default(Vector3), velocity = default(Vector3))` - in the repository [here](../../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.transformsynchronization/TransformSynchronizationHelper.cs).<br/>
Call this to add the SpatialOS components used by the transform synchronization module to your SpatialOS entity template. <br/>
You can optionally pass in a `rotation`, `location` or `velocity`. 

Call this during [entity templates creation](../entity-templates.md). 
* See an [example use](../entity-template-creation.md#transform-synchronization-module) in the *Entity template creation* documentation.
* Find out more in the [Transform Synchronization Feature Module](transform-feature-module.md) documentation.


### GameObject creation module

To access this module, use the `Improbable.Gdk.GameObjectCreation` namespace. It offers a default implementation of spawning GameObjects for your SpatialOS entities.

`Improbable.Gdk.GameObjectCreation`  is in the repository [here](../../../tree/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.gameobjectcreation). 

This module consists of:

*    `IEntityGameObjectCreator` -  in the repository [here](../../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.gameobjectcreation/IEntityGameObjectCreator.cs).
<br/>This is an interface to implement your customized version of the [Creation Feature Module](../gameobject/linking-spos-entities-gameobjects.md)) which you use for creating [GameObjects linked to SpatialOS entities]((./gameobject/linking-spos-entities-gameobjects.md)).
<br/>See the documentation on [How to link SpatialOS entities with GameObjects](../gameobject/linking-spos-entities-gameobjects.md).

* `GameObjectCreationHelper.EnableStandardGameObjectCreation(world)` - in the repository [here](../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.gameobjectcreation/GameObjectCreationHelper.cs).<br/>
Use this to enable the default implementation or with the parameters below to change the default.

* `GameObjectCreationHelper.EnableStandardGameObjectCreation(world,  entityGameObjectCreator)` - in the repository [here](../../../blob/master/workers/unity/Packages/com.improbable.gdk.gameobjectcreation/GameObjectCreationHelper.cs).<br/>
Use this enable custom spawning by passing in parameters to change the default.


Call these during [entity templates creation](../entity-templates.md).
