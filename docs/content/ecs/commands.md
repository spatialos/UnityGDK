## ECS: Sending and receiving commands

Commands are SpatialOS's equivalent of remote procedure calls.

> For more information about what commands are and what their purpose is, see [this section on commands](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/design/commands#component-commands) in the SpatialOS documentation.

### Sending command requests

A worker instance can send a command using a `ComponentName.CommandSenders.CommandName` ECS component, where `ComponentName` is the SpatialOS component the command is defined in and `CommandName` is the name of the command in schema.

Note that a worker instance _does not need_ authority over the relevant SpatialOS component to send commands to a SpatialOS entity.

Because of this, the SpatialOS GDK for Unity (GDK) attaches a `ComponentName.CommandSenders.CommandName` for each command to all ECS entities that represent a SpatialOS entity. This means any ECS entity can send any command to any SpatialOS entity.

Given this schema:

```
package playground;
import "improbable/transform.transform.schema"

type BuildRequest
{
    improbable.transform.Location location = 1;
    improbable.transform.Quaternion rotation = 2;
}

type BuildResponse
{
    bool success = 1;
    string error_message = 2;
    EntityId created_entity_id = 3;
}

component Builder
{
    id = 12002;
    command BuildResponse build_wall(BuildRequest);
}
```

The GDK generates these types:

* `BuildRequest` - Equivalent of the schema type.
* `BuildResponse` - Equivalent of the schema type.
* `Builder.BuildWall.Request` - Represents a `build_wall` command request that you wish to send. Holds metadata associated with the request (for example, the target EntityId) and a `BuildRequest` struct.
* `Builder.BuildWall.Response` - Represents the `build_wall` command response that you wish to send. We provide two helper methods for constructing these: `CreateResponse` for successful commands and `CreateFailure` for unsuccessful commands.
* `Builder.BuildWall.ReceivedRequest` - Represents a `build_wall` command request that you have received. Holds metadata associated with the request (for example, the caller attribute set) and a `BuildRequest` struct.
* `Builder.BuildWall.ReceivedResponse` - Represents a `build_wall` command response that you have received. Holds metadata associated with the response (for example, the status code). If the command was successful the `ResponsePayload` field will be set and if the command was unsuccessful the `Message` field will be set.

The corresponding ECS component for sending commands is `Builder.CommandSenders.BuildWall`, which has a list of `Builder.BuildWall.Request` objects on it. To send a command, add a new request object to the list.

Here's an example of sending a command request:

```csharp
public class BuildSystem : ComponentSystem
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public readonly int Length;
        public ComponentDataArray<ShouldSendBuildWallCommand> DenotesShouldSendCommand; // Non-SpatialOS component
        public ComponentDataArray<Builder.CommandSenders.BuildWall> BuildWallSender;
        public ComponentDataArray<SpatialEntityId> EntityIds;
    }

    [Inject] Data data;

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        for(var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            var requestSender = data.BuildWallSender[i];
            var targetEntityId = data.EntityIds[i];

            Builder.BuildWall.Request request = new Builder.BuildWall.CreateRequest
            (
                targetEntityId,
                new BuildRequest
                (
                    Location = new Location(...),
                    Rotation = new Rotation(...)
                )
            );

            requestSender.RequestsToSend.Add(request);
        }
    }
}
```

This system is an example of sending command requests. Unity injects all ECS entities which have the `ShouldSendBuildWallCommand`, `Builder.CommandSenders.BuildWall`, and `SpatialEntityId` components into this system before `OnUpdate`. This system iterates over the injected entities and sends a `build_wall` command request to each of them.

To send a `build_wall` command in a system, you need to inject `Builder.CommandSenders.BuildWall` into the system like any other ECS component.

### Responding to command requests

When a worker instance receives a command request, the command request is represented with reactive ECS components.

The GDK attaches a `ComponentName.CommandRequests.CommandName` ECS component to the specified ECS entity: where `ComponentName` is the SpatialOS component the command is defined in, `CommandName` is the name of the command in schema. `ComponentName.CommandRequests.CommandName` contains a list of type `ComponentName.CommandName.ReceivedRequest`. The GDK cleans it up at the end of the tick.

To respond to the request, use `ComponentName.CommandResponders.CommandName` for that given command. This contains a list of type `ComponentName.CommandName.Response`. Create and add a `ComponentName.CommandName.Response` object to this list and the GDK will send the response for you.

Here's an example of receiving a command request and acting on it, using the same schema as above:

```csharp
public class BuildWallHandlerSystem : ComponentSystem
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public readonly int Length;
        public ComponentDataArray<Builder.CommandRequests.BuildWall> BuildWallRequests;
        public ComponentDataArray<Builder.CommandResponders.BuildWall> BuildWallResponders;
    }

    [Inject] Data data;

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        for(var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            var requests = data.BuildWallRequests[i];
            var responder = data.BuildWallResponders[i];

            foreach (var request in requests.Requests)
            {
                // Do something with the request
                var buildRequest = request.Request;

                Builder.BuildWall.Response buildResponse = Builder.BuildWall.CreateResponse
                (
                    buildRequest,
                    new BuildResponse(...)
                );

                responder.ResponsesToSend.Add(buildResponse);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`build_wall` command requests are on a `Builder.CommandRequest.BuildWall` ECS component. The worker instance should respond to the request using the `Builder.CommandResponders.BuildWall` ECS component.

### Receiving command responses

Like requests, when an ECS entity receives a command response, the GDK attaches a `ComponentName.CommandResponses.CommandName` ECS component to the ECS entity, where `ComponentName` is the SpatialOS component the command is defined in and `CommandName` is the name of the command in schema.

`ComponentName.CommandResponses.CommandName` contains a list of `ComponentName.CommandName.ReceivedResponse`. The `ComponentName.CommandName.ReceivedResponse` includes the payload of the response and the request payload that was originally sent with the command. **This payload is null** when the command fails.

The ECS entity that sent the request receives the response.

Here's an example of receiving a command response, using the same schema as above:

```csharp
public class BuildWallResponseReceiver : ComponentSystem
{
    public struct Data
    {
        public readonly int Length;
        public ComponentDataArray<Builder.CommandResponses.BuildWall> BuildWallResponses;
    }

    [Inject] Data data;

    protected override void OnUpdate()
    {
        for(var i = 0; i < data.Length; i++)
        {
            var responses = data.BuildWallResponses[i];

            foreach (var response in responses.Responses)
            {
                if (response.StatusCode != StatusCode.Success)
                {
                    // Something bad happened!
                    continue;
                }

                var responsePayload = response.ResponsePayload; // guaranteed to not be null at this point
                var requestPayload = response.RequestPayload; // original request payload

                // Do something
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`build_wall` command responses are on a `Builder.CommandResponses.BuildWall` ECS component.
