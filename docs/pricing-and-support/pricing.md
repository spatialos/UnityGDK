# Pricing

The GDK for Unity uses SpatialOS core technology and cloud hosting. This means that when you use the GDK, you need to consider the SpatialOS pricing model.

SpatialOS has a free tier and a paid tier, and you can use the GDK on either of these. For an introduction to the pricing model, see [Pricing introduction](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/pricing-and-support/pricing-intro).

For more details, including information about what the free tier includes, an in-depth explanation of how we calculate prices, and examples of how much different types of games would cost, see [Pricing details](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/pricing-and-support/pricing-details).
