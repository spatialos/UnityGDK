### Set up your machine

#### Windows

| Step | Requirement | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Unity 2018.2.8](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) | Make sure to select the following components during installation: **Linux Build Support**, **Mac Build Support** |
| 2 | [.NET Core SDK (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1) | Verified with versions `2.1.3xx` and `2.1.4xx` |
| 3 | [SpatialOS](https://console.improbable.io/installer/download/stable/latest/win) | This installs the [spatial CLI](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/spatial-cli-introduction), the [SpatialOS Launcher](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/operate/launcher), and 32-bit and 64-bit Visual C++ Redistributables |
| 4 | Code Editor | We recommend either [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). |

> After installing the .NET Core SDK, you should restart any Unity and Unity Hub processes. This will prevent errors where Unity cannot find the `dotnet` executable.

##### Visual Studio

If you are using Visual Studio, within the Visual Studio Installer, on the **Workloads** tab:

- Select **Game development with Unity**
- Select **.NET Core cross-platform development**
- In the **Summary** on the right:
  - Deselect **Unity 2017.2 64-bit Editor** (the SpatialOS GDK for Unity requires Unity 2018.2.8)
  - Make sure **Visual Studio Tools for Unity** is selected

> **Warning**: Older versions of Visual Studio 2017 have been known to cause some issues with Unity 2018.2.8 - the issues are projects loading and unloading frequently, and Intellisense breaking. If you do experience these issues, try updating to a newer version of Visual Studio 2017.

If you are using Rider, install the [**Unity Support** plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity) for a better experience
