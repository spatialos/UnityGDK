# SpatialOS GDK for Unity documentation

#### How to get started
We recommend you start by following the [Installation and setup guide](setup-and-installing.md) to set up the GDK Core and its accompanying example scene, the Playground. You can then explore what the SpatialOS GDK for Unity (GDK) Core does from there. Use the [SpatialOS GDK for Unity: Contents](#documentation) documentation, listed below, to explore how the GDK Core works.

Note that the GDK documentation assumes that you are familiar with SpatialOS concepts and the Unity ECS.

We want your feedback on the GDK, its documentation and its [roadmap (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/29tMKyQC) - see [Give us feedback](../README.md#give-us-feedback).

## Questions?

## Documentation

#### SpatialOS
The GDK documentation assumes you are familiar with SpatialOS concepts. For guidance on SpatialOS concepts see the documentation on the [SpatialOS website](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos).

#### Entity Component System
The GDK currently uses the `0.0.12-preview.11` version of the entities preview packages.
The GDK documentation assumes you are familiar with the Unity Entity Component System. See:
* This overview [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U9wRgQyy6s) from [Brackeys](http://brackeys.com/).
* The more detailed documentation from Unity on the ECS [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/Documentation/index.md).

#### SpatialOS GDK for Unity

If you're new to the SpatialOS GDK for Unity, check out the docs under [Getting started](#getting-started) and [Concepts](#concepts-and-features), and then look at the Playground project included in the repo and get a feel for using the GDK with either [GameObjects and MonoBehaviours](#using-the-gdk-with-gameobjects-and-monobehaviours) or with [Unity ECS](#using-the-gdk-with-unity-ecs).

Once you are comfortable with the GDK and want to start a separate project, you will want to look at the section on [Configuring your project](#configuring-your-project).
