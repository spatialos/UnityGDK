# Upload and launch your game

### 1. Set your SpatialOS project name

When you signed up for SpatialOS, your account was automatically associated with an organisation and a project, both of which have the same generated name.

<br/>
**Step 1.** Find this name by going to the [Console](https://console.improbable.io/projects).

The name should look something like `beta_randomword_anotherword_randomnumber`.

<br/>
**Step 2.** Update your `spatialos.json`.

Using a text editor of your choice, open `gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project/spatialos.json` and replace the `unity_gdk` project name with the project name you were assigned in the Console. This tells SpatialOS which SpatialOS project you intend to upload to.

Your `spatialos.json` should look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "beta_yankee_hawaii_621",
  "project_version": "0.0.1",
  "sdk_version": "13.7.1-gdk-for-unity",
  "dependencies": [
      {"name": "standard_library", "version": "13.7.1-gdk-for-unity"}
  ]
}
```

<br/>
**Step 3.** Reference your Unity project in the Deployment Launcher window.

Open the [Deployment Launcher]({{urlRoot}}/modules/deployment-launcher/overview#change-my-project-in-the-deployment-launcher) window in your Unity Editor by selecting **SpatialOS** > **Deployment Launcher**.

Ensure the `Project Name` matches the one specified in your `spatialos.json`. If it does not match, press the refresh button at the top of the Deployment Launcher window to update the project name.

<br/>

### 2. Upload your worker assemblies

An [assembly](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/<%(Var key="worker_sdk_version")%>/shared/glossary#assembly) is a bundle of code, art assets and other files necessary to run your game in the cloud.

To run a deployment in the cloud, you need to upload the worker assemblies to your SpatialOS project.

Ensure that the `Assembly Name` is set in the **Assembly Upload** section of your Deployment Launcher window. The assembly name is a string you choose made up of alphanumeric characters, `_`, `.`, and `-`. For example, `my_assembly`.

_Example Deployment Launcher window showing the Assembly Upload section completed_

Select **Upload assembly** to start the upload.

> **TIP**: If you want to overwrite an existing assembly, ensure the `Force Upload` option is enabled.

</p>

> **TIP:** Depending on your network speed, the upload may take a little while (1-10 minutes) to complete.

<%(Callout message="
The assembly has finished uploading when:

* You see the following message in your Unity Editor Console window: `Upload of <assembly_name> succeeded.`
* The notification at the bottom of the Deployment Launcher window has disappeared.
")%>

### 3. Launch a cloud deployment

The next step is to start a cloud deployment using the assembly that you just uploaded.

You should find that the `my_deployment` configuration is already pre-completed in the FPS Starter Project. Ensure that you have chosen to launch the `my_deployment` configuration, then select **Launch deployment**.

<%(#Expandable title="What should my Deployment Launcher window look like?")%>
<img src="{{assetRoot}}assets/full-dpl-launcher-window.png" style="margin: 0 auto; width: auto; display: block;" />
<%(/Expandable)%>

> **Note:** You will see that there is a configuration with two deployments listed in the Deployment Launcher window. The first listed is your FPS Starter Project, the second is a deployment for [simulated players]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#simulated-player). You will find out more about simulated players in later steps.

This starts the process of launching your deployments. This may take a few minutes.

<%(Callout message="
It’s finished when the notification at the bottom of the Deployment Launcher window disappears and the Console pages for both deployments open automatically in your browser.
")%>

<br/>
## Well done getting set up!

It’s time to play your game.
