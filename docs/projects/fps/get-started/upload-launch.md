# Upload and launch your game

<br/>
### 1. Set your SpatialOS project name

When you signed up for SpatialOS, your account was automatically associated with an organisation and a project, both of which have the same generated name.

<br/>
**Step 1.** Find this name by going to the [Console](https://console.improbable.io/projects).

The name should look something like `beta_randomword_anotherword_randomnumber`.

_Example autogenerated SpatialOS project name_

<br/>
**Step 2.** Update your `spatialos.json`.

Using a text editor of your choice, open `gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project/spatialos.json` and replace the `unity_gdk` project name with the project name you were assigned in the Console. This tells SpatialOS which SpatialOS project you intend to upload to.

Your `spatialos.json` should look something like this:

```json
{
  "name": "beta_yankee_hawaii_621",
  "project_version": "0.0.1",
  "sdk_version": "13.6.2-gdk-for-unity",
  "dependencies": [
      {"name": "standard_library", "version": "13.6.2-gdk-for-unity"}
  ]
}
```

<br/>
**Step 3.** Reference your Unity project in the Deployments window.

  - To open the Deployments window, in your Unity Editor, select **SpatialOS** > **Deployment Launcher**.
  - Enter your project name in the `Project Name` field at the top of the window. (Use the one you just located in the SpatialOS Console.)

<%(Callout message="The Deployments window is currently only available as part of the FPS Starter Project.")%>

<br/>

### 2. Upload your worker assemblies

An [assembly](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/glossary#assembly) is a bundle of code, art assets and other files necessary to run your game in the cloud.

To run a deployment in the cloud, you need to upload the worker assemblies to your SpatialOS project. <br/>

**Step 1.** Fill out the **Assembly** section of the **Deployments** window

In the **Assembly** section of the Deployments window, enter the **Assembly Name** field. 

The assembly name is a string you choose made up of alphanumeric characters, `_`, `.`, and `-`; for example `my_assembly`.

<br/>
**Step 2.** Select **Upload Assembly** to start the upload.

> **TIP**: If you want to overwrite an existing assembly, ensure the `Force Upload` option is enabled.

<p/>

> **TIP:** Depending on your network speed, the upload may take a little while (1-10 minutes) to complete.

<%(Callout message="It’s finished uploading when You see an upload report printed in your Unity Console, for example:<br/><br/>**Uploaded assembly my_assembly to project unity_gdk successfully.**")%>

<br/>

### 3. Launch a cloud deployment

The next step is to start a cloud deployment using the assembly that you just uploaded.

<br/>
**Step 1.** Enter the parameters in the **Deployment Launcher** section of the Deployments window.
<br/>

| Setting name | Setting value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Assembly Name** | The name you gave the assembly above - for example: `myassembly`. | The name needs to conform to the following regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{5,64}`.|
| **Deployment Name** | A name of your choice - for example: `shootyshooty`. | The name needs to conform to the following regex: `[a-z0-9_]{2,32}`. |
| **Snapshot File** | `snapshots/cloud.snapshot` | This is a relative path from the root of your SpatialOS project. |
| **Launch Config File** | `cloud_launch_large.json`| This is a relative path from the root of your SpatialOS project. |
| **Deployment Region** | Select the geographical location closest to you for lower latencies when connecting clients. | You can set this to `US` for the USA (default) or `EU` for Europe. <br/> Note that the simulated players deployment deploys to the same region - you will find out more about simulated players in later steps. |
| **Enable Simulated Players** | Ensure this is checked.| This starts a second deployment for your simulated players. |
|**Override Name**| Leave this unchecked. | This allows you to change the name of the simulated players deployment - more about simulated players in the next steps. |
| **Deployment Name**<br/> (The second Deployment Name listed) | N/A | This field should be un-editable. You can edit this if you check **Override Name** |
| **Launch Config File**<br/> (The second config listed) |`cloud_launch_large_sim_players.json` | This is a relative path from the root of your SpatialOS project. |

<br/>

> **Note:** You will see that there are two Deployment Names and two Launch Config Files listed in the Deployment window; the first listed is your FPS Starter Project, the second is a deployment for simulated players. You will find out more about simulated players in later steps.

<br/>
**Step 2.** In the **Deployments** window, select **Launch deployments**.

This starts the process of launching your deployments. This may take a few minutes.
<%(Callout message="It’s finished when the Console pages for both deployments open automatically in your browser.<br/><br/>You should also see two messages printed in your Unity Console indicating both deployments have started:<br/><br/>**Successfully created the main deployment.**<br/><br/>**Successfully created the simulated player deployment.**")%>

<br/>
## Well done getting set up!

It’s time to play your game.
