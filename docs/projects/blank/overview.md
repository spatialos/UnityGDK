# Blank Starter Project

We recommend you get going by following the [Get started]({{urlRoot}}/projects/fps/get-started/get-started) guide. It's a step-by-step setup guide which uses the FPS Starter Project and leads on to a tutorial on how to add your first feature. However, the Blank Starter Project is a great starting point for working on the SpatialOS GDK for Unity if you want to start with an empty project.

You can find the [Blank Starter Project on Github](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-blank-project).

## What does it come with?

It has the minimum GDK feature set you need to start developing games for SpatialOS:

- A Unity project already set up with the SpatialOS GDK for Unity.
- Sample [local and cloud deployment]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#deploying) configurations.
- An empty [snapshot]({{urlRoot}}/reference/concepts/snapshots#snapshots).
- [Client-worker and server-worker]({{urlRoot}}/reference/glossary#worker) JSON [configuration files](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/worker-configuration/bridge-config#worker-attribute-sets).
- Client-worker and server-worker [worker connectors]({{urlRoot}}/reference/workflows/monobehaviour/worker-connectors) and worker prefabs.
- [Worker build configuration]({{urlRoot}}/projects/myo/build#build-your-workers).
- A set of Unity Scenes to use in development.

> **Note:** Whichever route you choose, you need basic proficiency in [programming in Unity](https://unity3d.com/programming-in-unity), version control systems (such as [Git](https://try.github.io/)), and command line interfaces (CLI) to use the SpatialOS GDK for Unity.
