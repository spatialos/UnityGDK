# Overview

This tutorial series aims to teach you how to perform basic SpatialOS interactions using the GDK for Unity.

The GDK is composed of three layers:

* **GDK Core:** an integration with our cloud platform SpatialOS.
* **Feature Modules:** a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems.
* **Starter Projects:** example projects you can use to start developing a game on top of.

Starting from the [Blank Project](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-blank-project), you’ll learn how to integrate some of our Feature Modules, gain an understanding of fundamental SpatialOS concepts, and grasp how they relate to the GDK.

---

In the first chapter of the series, you’re going to look at what the Blank Project contains, run the Blank project locally on your machine, and explore how the included Player Lifecycle module works.
