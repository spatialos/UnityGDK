# 1.5 - Summary

In this chapter, we introduced the key pieces of the Blank Project, what it contains and what it can do out-of-the-box. We walked through how to get started with local development, by starting a local deployment and connecting a client-worker and server-worker through a single scene in the Unity editor. We also looked into how the Player Lifecycle module works, and demonstrated how heartbeating works.

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to instantiate a basic level and set up the GameObject Creation module to spawn a player object.
