The FPS starter project is a great starting point for working on the SpatialOS GDK for Unity. Many projects, whatever their genre, share some core elements and this starter project can get you off to a easy start.

The SpatialOS GDK can help you run your games at scale, making it easy for even a small team to make a massive multiplayer hit game. The FPS starter project is already configured to scale-up, and you can test it out right now! Check out the [FPS at scale]({{urlRoot}}/get-started) guide to dive right in!

### Licensing

We will continue to make the FPS Starter Project a streamlined example of best practice that we _**want**_ you to build on top of. The FPS starter project is shared under the Improbable license, and you can read more about what that entails in our [licensing]({{urlRoot}}/license) section.
