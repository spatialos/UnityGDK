// Make sure you setup using the setup guide

# What will be covered?

This tutorial will implement a simple health pack pickup that will grant health to players who walk over it. The amount of health granted will be fixed, and the health pack will be consumed through use, and respawn a little later.

To implement this feature we will:

* Define a new health pack entity and its data
* Add health pack entities to the snapshot so they appear in the world
* Write pick-up logic so packs grant health to players

# Defining a new entity type

Every SpatialOS entity consists of SpatialOS components, defined in the project's [schema](fix).

In the FPS starter project the existing entities, such as the `Player` entity type, have components for movement, health, shooting and other mechanics. The project is constructed from GDK packages, such as the `SpatialOS GDK Health` package, which you can open from within the Unity project. In many of these packages you will find a `schema` folder, with files like `health.schema`.

### Entity components

We will give your health pack entities two pieces of data by defining it in a new component:

* The amount of health the pack will grant.
* A flag indicating whether the health pack is active, or has been consumed.

Create a `schema` directory in your project root, if it doesn't already exist. Then create a `pickups` directory within that.

<%(#Expandable title="Where is my 'project root'?")%>Your SpatialOS 'project root' is the top-level directory which also contains your `spatialos.json` configuration file, and likely a directory called `workers` that contains the FPS Unity project. You will not be able to see this directory from within your Unity editor, and should use File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on Mac) to create your new directory.<%(/Expandable)%>

Within your `schema/pickups/` directory create a new file called `health_pickup.schema` and paste in the following definition:

```
package pickups;
component HealthPickup {
    id = 21001;
    bool is_active = 1;
    uint32 health_value = 2;
}
```

This defines a new SpatialOS component called `HealthPickup`, and adds two properties: `is_active` and `health_value`. The component id must be chosen by you, and the only requirement is that it is unique among all other components in the project. Each of the properties has a property number (e.g. `= 1`) associated with it, which is **not** an initial value. It is a number that identifies the order in which these properties will appear within the component.

Any time you you modify your `schema` files you **must** then run code generation. You do this from the SpatialOS menu by clicking **Generate code**.

Code generation creates C# helper classes to allow you to make use of your `schema` within your game's code. It therefore must be run in order to make used of your newly defined `HealthPickup` component within your game logic. It's worth noting that when writing schemalang your properties must use snake case (e.g. "health_value"), and the code generation process will create the helper classes with PascalCase (i.e. "HealthValue").

<%(#Expandable title="What happens if I don't run code generation?")%>If you do not run code generation after modifying your `schema` files (which includes adding, removing or editing existing `.schema` files) then the associated C# helper classes will not be generated. This will mean that your C# interface to the data model of your game will not match your the structures defined in your `schema`. This can be very confusing!

If you are worried your generated code is in a bad state (such as having helper classes for since-deleted components and properties) you can run **Generate code (force)** from the SpatialOS menu to ensure existing generated code is cleaned and regenerated.
<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="Where is the generated code?")%>The generated classes for your component are in [!!!](fix) Feel free to have a look if you want to see what happens behind the scenes when you use a component. Note that you donâ€™t need to understand the generated code in order to follow this tutorial.
<%(/Expandable)%>


### Entity templates

Health pickups are a new entity, and we must next define which components should be instantiated each time a new 'health pickup' is created.

Typical for SpatialOS GDK projects, the FPS starter project contains a C# file that declares a function for each type of entity. Calling the function returns an `Entity` object, with the contents of the function defining which components form that entity type. Extending an existing entity type is as easy as adding additional components while the entity type is being constructed.

You can find this file in your Unity project: `/Assets/Fps/Scripts/Config/FpsEntityTemplates.cs`.

To define an entirely new entity type we will need to add a new function within the `FpsEntityTemplates` class:

```csharp
public static Entity HealthPickup(Vector3f position, int healthValue)
{
    var gameLogic = WorkerUtils.UnityGameLogic;

    var healthPickupComponent = Pickups.HealthPickup.Component.CreateSchemaComponentData(true, healthValue);

    return EntityBuilder.Begin()
        .AddPosition(position.X, position.Y, position.Z, gameLogic)
        .AddMetadata("HealthPickup", gameLogic)
        .SetPersistence(true)
        .SetReadAcl(AllWorkerAttributes)
        .AddComponent(healthPickupComponent, gameLogic)
        .Build();
}
```

The [EntityBuilder](fix) syntax provides a compact way to declare the relevant components. You may notice that `.AddPosition`, `.AddMetadata`, and `.SetPersistence` appear in the entity template function of _every_ entity type. This is because these are mandatory "well-known components" that SpatialOS expects.

<%(#Expandable title="What are the 'well-known components' (Position, Metadata, Persistence) used for?")%>The SpatialOS 'well-known components' are for information that are almost always necessary on each entity.

**Position** is the canonical world position of the entity which, most importantly, is used by the SpatialOS load-balancer when dividing work between workers on a proximity basis.

**Metadata** is an identifier of the type of entity. The SpatialOS GDK for Unity uses `Metadata` for matching to a Unity prefab name within your project.

**Persistence** indicates whether the entity should appear in snapshots that are saved out at run-time.

To find out more you can read up on [well-known components](fix)<%(/Expandable)%>

[!!!](TODO: Talk about position being default/required)

[!!!](TODO: Troubleshooting for HealthComponent not recognised?)

#### Adding components

Your `HealthComponent` has generated a `Pickups.HealthPickup.Component.CreateSchemaComponentData()` function. The property numbers (i.e. `= 1` and `= 2`) determine the order of properties the function expects as parameters.

This component can then be added to the `HealthPickup` entity using the line: `.AddComponent(healthPickupComponent, gameLogic)`. The three "well-known components" (`Position`, `Metadata` and `Persistence`) must appear in that order, but after that you are free to add your remaining components in any order you like. Just remember that to complete the pattern the final call must be to `.Build();`.

#### Setting permissions (ACLs)

[Access Control Lists](fix) are how SpatialOS specifies which workers have permission to read-from or write-to the values of certain components. There may be data which you want to be kept private to server-side workers (because clients might use that knowledge to cheat!). Some components should definitely restrict their write-access to specific workers (e.g. a particular player's client) or to server-side workers only, to prevent exploits. For example, in an RPG a player should probably not be able to update the amount of gold they are carrying (at least, not without the server-side validating they aren't cheating!).

In the EntityBuilder syntax, the `.SetReadAcl(AllWorkerAttributes)` function call stated that all worker types should be able to read the data for this entity.

For each of the other components, such as your newly added `HealthPickup` component, the worker type which is given write-access is specified as a second argument to the component-adding function, e.g. `WorkerUtils.UnityGameLogic`. This is simply a string which identifies which worker type should be granted the relevant permission.

For this project, `UnityGameLogic` indicates that that worker is one for handling server-side game logic. The identifier `WorkerUtils.UnityClient` would indicate that all clients are granted the relevant permission, but in this case we don't want clients to be able to alter how much health a health pack grants players, so we pass `WorkerUtils.UnityGameLogic` as the second parameter when adding the `healthPickupComponent`.

[!!!](TODO: Check whether this is correct about single string ACLs)

<%(#Expandable title="How would you give only a specific client write-access for a component?")%>Some component data should be editable/updateable by the player's client, but not by the clients of any other players. In the FPS starter project the `Player` entity template function in `FpsEntityTemplates.cs` grants the player's client write-access over a number of components: clientMovement, clientRotation, clientHeartbeat etc.

The information that specifies exactly _which_ client should be granted permission is passed into the function in the `clientAttributeSet` parameter. If you'd like to read more on where this information comes from you can read about the [TODO FIX LINK: entity lifecycle](fix).<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="Can I rename my worker types?")%>Yes, worker types are customizable, but we don't recommend it.

As is typical for GDK projects, the FPS starter project uses `UnityGameLogic` for server-side workers, and `UnityClient` for client-side workers. To find out more about renaming worker types you can read about [build configuration](fix)<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="Can I specify more than one worker type to have write-access to a single component?")%>Yes, you are not restricted to just one worker type being granted write-access, but it's something to be careful of.



To find out about how to do this, read up about [worker attribute sets](fix)
<%(/Expandable)%>

### Adding entities to the world

Once an entity template function exists you have a way to construct the _template_ of an entity. To add a health pack entity to the world

* At runtime, by passing an `Entity` object to an entity creation function.
* At start-time, by adding an entity instance to the [Snapshot](fix) so it is already in the world when the game begins.

For health packs we will do the latter. When the game begins there will already be health packs in pre-defined locations.

#### Editing snapshot generation

The SpatialOS menu option in the Unity editor include an item **"Generate FPS Snapshot"**. This runs the script `/Assets/Fps/Scripts/Editor/SnapshotGenerator/SnapshotMenu.cs`, which you can find from within your Unity editor.

We will modify the snapshot generating logic in two steps:
1. Adding a function to create and add a `HealthPack` entity.
2. Fix the package import settings so use of `Vector3f` is valid.

Within the `SnapshotMenu` class, add a new method that will contain logic for adding health pack entities to the snapshot object:

```csharp
private static void AddHealthPacks(Snapshot snapshot)
{
    var healthPack = FpsEntityTemplates.HealthPickup(new Vector3f(5, 0, 0), 100);
    snapshot.AddEntity(healthPack);
}
```

The `Vector3f` type is a struct provided in the `Improbable` namespace, and initially the above code snippet will produce errors. You must add `using Improbable;` to the top of `SnapshotMenu.cs`. Then in your Unity editor Project window, navigate to `/Assets/Fps/Scripts/Editor/`, and select `Improbable.Fps.Editor` so that its Import Settings can be viewed in the Unity inspector panel.

The `Improbable.FPS.Editor` *Import Settings* window contains a section called **References**. You must click the `+` button to add a new reference, double-click the new field and in the asset-finder pop-up that appears, you must select `Improbable.Gdk.Generated`. This is because the `Vector3f` struct is defined within that particular assembly, and we must declare our intent to use this package.

Once you've added and applied this new package reference your use of `Vector3f` in `SnapshotGenerator.cs` will now be valid.

<%(#Expandable title="Why does the FPS starter project use packages?")%>Unity's packaging system is a great way to organize your code. SpatialOS GDK projects use packages extensively to provide modular code that can be easily imported and re-used across projects. If you'd like to know more about packages you can read up about [GDK Feature Modules](fix) which make good use of packages.<%(/Expandable)%>

This script now creates a health pack entity at position `(5, 0, 0)`, and sets the amount of health it will restore to 100. Don't forget to call your new function from within `GenerateDefaultSnapshot()` (and pass it the `snapshot` object) or else it won't be run during snapshot generation!

```csharp
[MenuItem("SpatialOS/Generate FPS Snapshot")]
private static void GenerateDefaultSnapshot()
{
    var snapshot = new Snapshot();
   
    var spawner = FpsEntityTemplates.Spawner();
    snapshot.AddEntity(spawner);

    AddHealthPacks(snapshot);

    SaveSnapshot(snapshot);
}
```

It's a great idea to separate default values (such as health pack positions, and health values) into a settings file. In the FPS starter project you can find lots of examples of using Unity `ScriptableObject` components for exactly that. But for now, we will keep this example simple.

#### Updating the snapshot

Snapshot files are found in your project root directory, in a directory named `snapshots`. The FPS starter project includes a snapshot called `default.snapshot`.

If you have updated the snapshot generation function (as you just did in the step above), or if you've altered which components are specified in one of your entity templates, then your snapshot will be out of date. The snapshot is a big list of entities, and all their individual component values, so any change to these and the snapshot file must be regenerated.

You can regenerate the `default.snapshot` file from the SpatialOS menu option in the Unity editor, by running **"Generate FPS Snapshot"**.

<%(#Expandable title="Can I make my snapshots human-readable?")%>Yes, there is a `spatial` command that will convert snapshots to a human-readable format. However, you cannot launch a deployment from a human-readable snapshot, so it must be converted back to binary before it is usable. To find out more about working with snapshots you can read about the [spatial snapshot command](fix).

While they are human-readable you are able to manually edit the values of the properties within, however be careful not to make mistakes that will inhibit the conversion back to binary form!<%(/Expandable)%>

### Representing the entity on your workers

If we were to test the game at this point, the health pack entity would appear in the inspector but not in-game. This is because we have not yet defined how to represent the entity.

SpatialOS will manage which subset of the world's entities each worker knows about, and provide them with the corresponding component data. You must define what the worker will do when it finds out about an entity it isn't currently tracking. Fortunately the SpatialOS GDK for Unity provides some great tools for exactly that!

#### Planning your entity representations

First we must think about how each of the workers will want to represent the entity, so let's return to how we want our game mechanic to play out:

* Players should see a hovering health pack.
* When a player runs through the health pack it is consumed and "disappears", leaving just a marker on the ground.
* Consuming a health pack should only occur if the player has taken damage.
* Consumed health packs re-appear after a cool-down, and are ready for use again.

We can neatly separate this logic between the client-side and server-side representations:

* The `UnityClient` worker should display a visual representation for each health pack, based on whether the health pack is currently "active".
* The `UnityGameLogic` worker should react to collisions with players, check whether they are injured, and consume the health pack if they are.

#### Creating GameObject representations

The FPS starter project uses the SpatialOS GDK's GameObject workflow, which is the familiar way of working with Unity Engine.

In the GameObject workflow you can associate a Unity prefab with your entity type, with separate prefabs for your `UnityClient` and `UnityGameLogic` workers. All entity prefabs should be added to `/Assets/Fps/Resources/Prefabs/UnityClient` and `/Assets/Fps/Resources/Prefabs/UnityGameLogic` respectively.

The FPS starter project uses the "GDK GameObject Creation" package which handles the instantiation of GameObjects to represent SpatialOS entities. This tracks associations between entities and prefabs by matching their `Metadata` component's metadata string to the names of prefabs in the `/Assets/Fps/Resources/Prefabs/` directory. If the worker receives information about a new SpatialOS entity then the GameObject Creation package immediately instantiates a GameObject of the appropriate type to represent that entity.

<%(#Expandable title="What are the 'Authoritative' and 'NonAuthoritative' sub-folders for?")%>The `/Assets/Fps/Resources/Prefabs/UnityClient/` folder contains two sub-folders, `Authoritative` and `NonAuthoritative`, and _both_ of them contain a `Player` prefab!

The FPS starter project has some custom logic specific to its `Player` entities. When creating your own entity prefabs for the `UnityClient` worker you can put them directly into `/Assets/Fps/Resources/Prefabs/UnityClient/`.

If you are interested in why the FPS starter project named those sub-directories `Authoritative` and `NonAuthoritative`, it relates to write-access for components on the entity.

At any point in time a single entity may be known about by multiple workers, even of the same type. In a large game you might have multiple `UnityGameLogic` workers. These often overlap, which means that they both "know about" some of the same entities. However, only **one** of those workers can have write-access permissions to components on an entity at any given time.

That means even two workers of the same type (e.g. `UnityGameLogic`) may not have the same responsibilities for a particular entity. The **authoritative** worker (i.e. the one that has write-access) may be responsible for executing some logic and updating the entity's component data. The **non-authoritative** worker only has read-access, which it may use to drive its own local representation of that entity, but it shouldn't try to update the entity's component values (and wouldn't be able to if it tried!). These two workers have _different representations_ of the same entity, even though they are the same type of worker.

The `Player` entity has a special relationship with the `UnityClient` instance that is authoritative over it. That `UnityClient` is running on the gamer's machine, and that gamer "owns" that `Player` entity. It's their representation in the world. As such, there are big differences between how `Player` entity should be represented on the authoritative client (it should have a camera, collect player input etc.) compared to if the `Player` entity represents someone else in the game. The FPS starter project has some additional logic to manage these representations as a way of keeping the code more organised.

Authority is a tricky topic with SpatialOS, particularly as write-access is actually defined on a per-component basis rather than a per-entity basis. You can find out more by reading up about [component authority](fix).<%(/Expandable)%>



##### Creating a UnityClient entity prefab

The FPS starter project contains a health pack prefab named `HealthPickup.prefab` in the folder: `/Assets/Fps/Prefabs/`. Have a look at it and create a copy in the `/Assets/Fps/Resources/Prefabs/UnityClient/` folder.

<%(#Expandable title="Can I name the prefab something else?")%>Your choice of prefab name can be anything, but **must** match the string you used for the entity's `Metadata` component when you wrote the entity template function for this entity.

This is because the FPS starter project uses the GDK GameObject Creation package as part of the GameObject workflow. To find out more you can read up about the [GameObject workflow](fix).<%(/Expandable)%>



<%(#Expandable title="What's the best way to create a prefab?")%>Prefabs are the Unity Engine approach for creating templates of GameObject hierarchies.

If you right-click in your project file hierarchy, you'll find an option `Create > Prefab`, which will create for prefab at that file location and allow you to rename it. This prefab is initially empty, so you can drag other prefabs or GameObjects onto it to add them to the hierarchy.

If you are using Unity 2018 and earlier then it can often be easiest to drag prefabs into a scene to edit them - just remember to drag them to apply your change (in the Unity Inspector panel) and delete them from the scene when you are done editing! In upcoming versions of Unity Engine you will be able to make use of [prefab mode](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/06/20/introducing-new-prefab-workflows/) for this task.<%(/Expandable)%>

When creating entity prefabs it is usually a great idea to create a root GameObject which will contain your SpatialOS components and behaviours, with art assets added as children (which will also help with disabling inactive health packs later!).

Add a new script component to the root of your `HealthPickup` prefab, name it `HealthPickupClientVisibility`, and replace its contents with the following code snippet:

```csharp
using Improbable.Gdk.GameObjectRepresentation;
using Pickups;
using UnityEngine;

namespace Fps
{
    [WorkerType(WorkerUtils.UnityClient)]
    public class HealthPickupClientVisibility : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [Require] private HealthPickup.Requirable.Reader healthPickupReader;

        private MeshRenderer cubeMeshRenderer;

        private void OnEnable()
        {
            cubeMeshRenderer = GetComponentInChildren<MeshRenderer>();
            healthPickupReader.ComponentUpdated += OnHealthPickupComponentUpdated;
            UpdateVisibility();
        }

        private void UpdateVisibility()
        {
            cubeMeshRenderer.enabled = healthPickupReader.Data.IsActive;
        }

        private void OnHealthPickupComponentUpdated(HealthPickup.Update update)
        {
            UpdateVisibility();
        }
    }
}
```

This script is mostly standard C# code that you could find in any game built with Unity Engine. There are a few annotations which are specific to the SpatialOS GDK, which we can look at more closely.

```csharp
[WorkerType(WorkerUtils.UnityClient)]
```

This annotation decorating the class indicates the `WorkerType` of the script (in this case, `UnityClient`). This provides information for SpatialOS when it is building out your separate workers: a script with the client annotation should never be enabled on a `UnityGameLogic` worker. You can use these `WorkerType` annotations to control where your code runs. If a script should exist and be able to run on both client-side and server-side workers then this annotation can be omitted.

This `HealthPickupClientVisibility` script is going to rely on the `is_active` property of your new `HealthPickup` component, so the package declared in the `health_pickup.schema` file appears in a `using` statement at the top of the script:

```csharp
using Pickups;
```

This namespace is part of the helper classes that the code generation phase created from your schema.

To make use of component data, either to read from it or write to it, we can use SpatialOS GDK syntax to inject the component into the script.

```csharp
[Require] private HealthPickup.Requirable.Reader healthPickupReader;
```

The worker on which the code is running interprets this statement as an instruction to only enable this script component on a particular entity's associated GameObject if that entity has a `HealthPickup` component, and the worker has read-access to that component. Read-access is rarely limited, but the same syntax can be used with `Writer` instead of `Reader`, which would make the requirement even stricter. With a `Writer`, the script would only be enabled on the single worker that has write-access to the `HealthPickup` component on that entity.

These `[Require]` attributes are another powerful way to control where your code is executed. For the purpose of this script we only need to _read_ the health pack's data when deciding how to visualise it, so only a `Reader` is necessary.

You can see a use of the `HealthPickup` component's data in the line:

```csharp
cubeMeshRenderer.enabled = healthPickupReader.Data.IsActive;
```

When you wrote the schema for the `HealthPickup` component you included a bool property called `is_active`, and code generation has created the `IsActive` member within the reader's `Data` object. We'll cover updating component property values later in this tutorial.

Setting the `cubeMeshRenderer.enabled` according to whether the health pack is "active" or not only works if `cubeMeshRender` correctly references the mesh renderer. Make sure you drag the child GameObject's mesh renderer to this field in the Unity Inspector panel to set the reference.

The client-side representation of the health pack entity is now complete! Next we will test the game so far and make sure we are visualising the health packs correctly.



<%(#Expandable title="Are entities always represented by GameObjects?")%>No, exactly how entities are represented on each of your workers is up to you.

The GDK also offers an [ECS workflow](fix) represents them as a grouping of Unity ECS components. If you are more familiar with the traditional Unity GameObject style of development then the GDK provides a [GameObject workflow](fix) for you too.

You are not limited to these options either, and can configure your worker to create something very custom when it encounters a particular entity type. To find out more about you can read up about [entity representations](fix).<%(/Expandable)%>



<%(#Expandable title="Can workers differ in how they represent the same entity?")%>Yes! The local in-worker representation for entities can be customized for each of your worker types. For example, the server-side `UnityGameLogic` worker may represent the `Player` entity with a GameObject that contains no visual assets or sound effects, because the server does not need those assets to perform its duties.

Similarly, !!!!!!! COME BACK TO THIS [!!!](fix)<%(/Expandable)%>

### Testing your changes

Our aim is to have health packs which restore lost health to players. So what have we accomplished so far?

* You defined the schema for your health packs: a new component containing properties for how much health it will grant and whether it's ready to do so.
* You created an entity template function which provides a central definition of a particular entity type and can create `Entity` objects.
* You added an instance of the health pack entity type to the snapshot so it will be present in the world when the game begins.
* You associated a local representation with your new SpatialOS entity so that Unity will know how to visually represent any health pack it encounters.

You can launch a local deployment of your updated game world from the SpatialOS menu within the Unity editor by clicking **"Local launch"**. This will open a terminal that should tell you when the world is ready.

Once the world is ready you can:

* View all entities in the inspector from your browser: http://localhost:21000/inspector/
* Click Play in your Unity editor (if you have the `FPS-Development` scene open) to play the game.

You'll know it's worked if you can see a `HealthPickup` entity in the inspector, and find a floating health pack when running around in-game. But currently they just sit there, inert. If you walk into them, nothing happens. Let's fix that!

Our next step will be to add some game logic to the health pack so that it reacts to player collisions and grants them health.

<%(#Expandable title="How does the Inspector decide the entity name?")%>In your entity template function the compulsory `Metadata` component required a string as a parameter, and we gave it "HealthPickup", but could have used any string. The metadata is intended to be a friendly identifier for the entity type, and as such is used by the Inspector to label your entity.

If you are using the SpatialOS GDK's GameObject workflow then the `Metadata` string must match the name of the entity prefab that will represent it.<%(/Expandable)%>

# Adding health pack logic

If we were to test the game at this point we would now see the health pack entity in-game, but we've not yet given it the consumption behaviour.

The server-side logic we want to capture for this game mechanic is:

* Tracking player collisions with the health pack.
* Checking the pre-conditions: player must be injured, health pack must be active.
* Granting health to a player when the conditions are met.

To do this we will need to create a server-side representation of the health pack, and add a script to the health pack which can both read its own component data (to check if the health pack is active) as well as that of the player entity (to check if it is injured). After that, if conditions are met, it then must also be able to _update_ its own component data (to set itself to "in-active"), and that of the player entity too (to grant it health).

### Creating a UnityGameLogic entity prefab

In the FPS starter project the server-side worker is called `UnityGameLogic`.

Create a copy of `/Assets/Fps/Prefabs/HealthPickup.prefab` in the `/Assets/Resources/Prefabs/UnityGameLogic/` folder. Because this prefab will only be used for instantiating server-side game objects, the visual components are not needed, so feel free to remove the child renderers. Respectively, the `Box Collider` is not needed for client-side workers, so you can remove that from `/Assets/Resources/Prefabs/UnityClient/HealthPickup.prefab` if you wish. Make sure you keep it in the `UnityGameLogic` copy of the prefab as we are about to use it to track player collisions with the health pack.

Then, add a script component to your new prefab called `HealthPickupServerBehaviour` and replace its contents with the following code snippet which contains a couple of pieces of code we still need to write:

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using Improbable.Gdk.Core;
using Improbable.Gdk.GameObjectRepresentation;
using Improbable.Gdk.Health;
using Pickups;
using UnityEngine;

namespace Fps
{
    [WorkerType(WorkerUtils.UnityGameLogic)]
    public class HealthPickupServerBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
    {
        [Require] private HealthPickup.Requirable.Writer healthPickupWriter;
        [Require] private HealthComponent.Requirable.CommandRequestSender healthCommandRequestSender;

        private void OnEnable()
        {
        }

        private void OnDisable()
        {
        }

        private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
        {
            // OnTriggerEnter is fired regardless of whether the MonoBehaviour is enabled/disabled.
            if (healthPickupWriter == null)
            {
                return;
            }
            
            if (!other.CompareTag("Player"))
            {
            	return;
            }

            HandleCollisionWithPlayer(other.gameObject);
        }

        private void SetIsActive(bool isActive)
        {
            // Not yet implemented: you need to replace this comment with code for updating the health pack component's "active" property
        }

        private void HandleCollisionWithPlayer(GameObject player)
        {
            var playerSpatialOsComponent = player.GetComponent<SpatialOSComponent>();

            if (playerSpatialOsComponent == null)
            {
                return;
            }

            // Not yet implemented: you need to replace this comment with code for notifying the Player entity that it will receive health.

            // Toggle health pack to its "consumed" state
            SetIsActive(false);
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet contains two comments that are placeholders for code which we will now write.

The first "not yet implemented" statement is in a function called `SetIsActive`. `IsActive` is the name of the bool property in the `HealthPickup` component you created, and we want this function to perform a **component update**, setting the value of `IsActive` to a given value. We want this update to be synchronized across all workers - updating the true state of that entity - and that can only be done by the single worker that has write-access.

<%(#Expandable title="Why is only one worker at a time able to have write-access for a component?")%>blah<%(/Expandable)%>

[!!!!!!!!](TODO: Write a thing for that expandable ^)

To make sure this script is only enabled on the worker with write-access it already has a statement at the top of the class which "requires" a `Writer`:

```csharp
[Require] private HealthPickup.Requirable.Writer healthPickupWriter;
```

A `Writer` can also be used to _read_ component data from its respective component (in this case, `HealthPickup`), but it provides an API for updating the values of properties too.

Unity Engine's `OnTriggerEnter` function is a special-case when a script is disabled. Other functions will only be called if the script component's `enabled` property is true, but `OnTriggerEnter` will be called even if it is false. This means it is an exception to the normal behaviour of the `[Require]` syntax. Because of this, scripts which use `OnTriggerEnter` **must** check whether the `Writer` is null (indicating a lack of authority) before using functions on the writer.

To update the `HealthPickup` component we must construct a `HealthPickup.Update` object, and **send** it to SpatialOS. You can replace the comment in the `SetIsActive` with the following snippet to handle creating and sending this update:

```csharp
healthPickupWriter?.Send(new HealthPickup.Update
{
    IsActive = new Option<BlittableBool>(isActive)
});
```

<%(#Expandable title="What is the 'Option' type?")%>blah<%(/Expandable)%>

[!!!](TODO: Write a thing for that expandable ^)

There is one more comment we must replace with code before our logic will work, which is found in the `HandleCollisionWithPlayer` function. The `Player` entity prefab has already been given a "Player" tag, so this function will be called any time a player walks through a health pack.

#### Cross-worker interaction using commands

Our `HandleCollisionWithPlayer` function will run on a `UnityGameLogic` worker (because of the `[WorkerType(WorkerUtils.UnityGameLogic)]` annotation). That worker executes the code on behalf of each `HealthPack` entity for which is has `HealthPickup` component write-access (because of the `Writer` requirement). If your game has multiple `UnityGameLogic` workers then the worker with write-access for the `HealthPack` entity may not be the same worker that has write-access for the `Player` entity who has tried to pick up the health pack.

If we want a `HealthPack` entity's script to update the `Player` entity's current health we must notify the responsible worker and _request_ the update. SpatialOS allows you to do this with [commands](fix), which are defined in **schema**.

The `Player` entity already has a `Health` component which defines both a property representing current health and a **command** called `modify_health`. The definition of that command in `health.schema` is:

```
command improbable.common.Empty modify_health(HealthModifier);
```

This command definition states that a `HealthModifier` object must be passed as an argument with the command request. `HealthModifier` is a type that is also defined in `health.schema`, which simply bundles a few properties together.

When you send a command it acts as a request which SpatialOS will deliver to the single worker that has write-access for the component in which the command is defined. If that worker has handling logic for that type of command then it will be triggered, and many commands also return a response. A command response can provide information generated as a result of the request, or can be used to indicate whether the request was accepted or not.

For this command the return type is specified as `improbable.common.Empty`, as we don't want to return any information to the sender.

In your `HandleCollisionWithPlayer` function, you can replace the placeholder comment with the following code snippet:

```csharp
healthCommandRequestSender.SendModifyHealthRequest(playerSpatialOsComponent.SpatialEntityId, new HealthModifier
{
    Amount = healthPickupWriter.Data.HealthValue
});
```

The top of the `HealthPickupServerBehaviour` class has a `[Require]` statement for `HealthComponent.Requireable.CommandRequestSender` which, appropriately enough, is necessary for sending commands that are defined in the `Health` component. Even though the `Health` component belongs to the `Player` entity, and this script is on the `HealthPickup` entity, this statement is still required.

Command request sender objects are automatically generated for you during code generation, based on your schema, and it provides a "send" function for each of the component's commands. Just by defining your commands in schema and running code generation all of these helper classes are generated ready for you to use.

The code snippet calls `SendModifyHealthRequest`, specifies the entity id of the recipient entity (in this case the player entity), and constructs a `HealthModifier` object with the appropriate data. In our case the amount of health we wish to grant is based on the `HealthPickup` entity's `HealthValue` property, so we retrieve the value from `healthPickupWriter.Data.HealthValue`.

The `ModifyHealth` command is already used by the FPS starter project for applying damage as part of the shooting game mechanics. As this is the case we don't need to write any _additional_ logic for applying the health increase.

#### Respawning health packs

Our health packs use the `IsActive` property to indicate whether they can be visualised (and whether they will grant health on collision). One final feature we will add is a co-routine to re-activate consumed health packs after a cool-down period.

In your `HealthPickupServerBehaviour` class, define a coroutine function that looks something like this:

```csharp
private IEnumerator RespawnCubeRoutine()
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(15f);
    SetIsActive(true);
}
```

Your coroutine should be started at the end of the `HandleCollisionWithPlayer` function. You should also start the coroutine in `OnEnable` for any health pack entities which are inactive (`IsActive` equal to `false`) to begin with. Running coroutines should also be stopped in `OnDisable`.

```
<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="Why would IsActive be false in OnEnable()?")%>In a large game, where there are multiple workers of each type (such as multiple `UnityGameLogic` workers), it is the SpatialOS load-balancer that decides how to divide write-access for components between the available workers. At run-time the load-balancer will dynamically adjust these authorities to provide the best performance.

The coroutine is local only to the worker that started it. If the worker loses write-access to the component then the script will become disabled for that entity (and if you've added a `StopCoroutine` call to `OnDisable` then the coroutine will be appropriately cancelled). In theory this leaves the entity in a state where `InActive` is false, and no coroutine is running that will eventually change that.

Just as one worker lost write-access, another will be granted it by the load-balancer. That newly authoritative worker now meets the criteria specified by the `[Require]` syntax in the `HealthPickupServerBehaviour` class, and so the script will become enabled.

This is why you should specify in `OnEnable()` that if the `IsActive` property is false at that point then the coroutine should be initiated.

The newly authoritative worker will not know how long the cool-down had already been running on the previous worker, so the cool-down timer is ultimately "refreshed" at this point. If this was a problem for our mechanic then we could store the timer's progress in a new property, but in this case we will keep it simple.<%(/Expandable)%>

#### Optional: Ignoring healthy players

The `HandleCollisionWithPlayer` function in your `HealthPickupServerBehaviour.cs` script currently attempts to heal any colliding player. If the player is already on full health we might want to ignore them so that the health pack is not consumed and the health modifier command is never sent.

At the beginning of the `HandleCollisionWithPlayer` function you could add an if-statement which reads the player's current health from `playerSpatialOsComponent` and returns early if their health is at maximum. In the code that handles incoming `ModifyHealthRequest` commands the player's health is clamped to the value of the `Health` component's `max_health` property, but it's preferable to avoid sending the request if we know it will be denied anyway.

# Testing health pickups locally

The distributed game logic is now in place, and we can test if it is working correctly. To test this feature, you can follow these steps:

<%(#Expandable title="1. Build your workers.")%>From the **SpatialOS** menu, click **Build UnityClient for local**.

This is necessary because you have modified the code for the workers. If you are running your workers from within the Unity editor a build is not necessary, however in a moment we will launch a built-out client worker. Building the workers is therefore essential.<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="2. Launch a local deployment.")%>From the **SpatialOS** menu, click **Local launch**. This will open a terminal which will notify you when the deployment is up and running.

It also provides a convenient link for the local SpatialOS Inspector.<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="3. Launch a built-out `UnityClient` worker.")%>From the **SpatialOS** menu, click **Launch standalone client**.

This will launch an instance of your `UnityClient` in a separate window. This uses the built-out `UnityClient` worker, so make sure you have performed  a "Build UnityClient for local" as in step 1.<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="4. Launch a second client in-editor.")%>With the `FPS-Development` scene open in the Unity editor, click the Unity `Play` button.<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="5. Use one client to shoot the other.")%>To see the effects of a health pack restoring a player's health it's a good idea to damage them first. Particularly if you made the optional changes to enforce the maximum health for players, you'll want to confirm that the health pack isn't disappearing without performing its health-giving duty.

This may require some switching between the editor and your standalone client, but you should be able to steer one player entity to the other and shoot them a few times.

You can use the SpatialOS inspector to help you find where the two players are, and navigate them to the same location. You can also select the icon for the damaged player and, in the right-side of the SpatialOS inspector, view the component data for the player's `Health` component to confirm that damage from the gunfire has been applied.<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="6. Use the inspector to check the damage has been applied.")%>When a local deployment is running you can open the SpatialOS local inspector in your browser: http://localhost:21000/inspector/

By selecting the visual marker for an entity you can view its component values in the right-side panel, by expanding the `Components` section.

Component values can be found by expanding the namespace for that component. For `Player` health you can find this under the namespace `improbable` > `gdk` > `health` > `HealthComponent` > `health`.<%(/Expandable)%>

<%(#Expandable title="7. Walk the damaged player over the health pack and check if it is consumed and applied.")%>Once again, you can use the SpatialOS inspector to guide you if you aren't quite sure where on the map the player and the health pack are in relation to each other.

**Don't forget to check how much health the player has before walking through the health pack so you can compare the before and after!**

When the injured player collides with the health pack it should become invisible on the client. You can also check in the SpatialOS inspector to see whether the `HealthPack` component for the health pack entity now shows its `IsActive` property value as `false`.

Finally, using the SpatialOS inspector, check how much health the player has after walking through the health pack. The `Player` health component can be found under the namespace `improbable` > `gdk` > `health` > `HealthComponent` > `health`.<%(/Expandable)%>

If you implemented the respawn coroutine then you should also see the health pack reappear after a short time.
