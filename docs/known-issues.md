| IL2CPP does not currently work on Mac as it crashes upon starting the game. This is due to a bug in Unity that does not initialize a system correctly, if one of the injected `IComponentData` contains a `long`.                                                                                                            | 2018/08/31 | 1076596                                                                                                | Use the Mono compiler.                                                |
| There is a bug in the preview version of the [High Definition Render Pipeline (Unity Blog)](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/03/16/the-high-definition-render-pipeline-focused-on-visual-quality/), where shaders do not fully compile and appear visually darker than intended.                                               | 2018/10/12 | [566245](https://forum.unity.com/threads/shadergraph-subgraph-importing-bug-on-shared-project.566245/) | Manually reimport shaders.                                            |
| The Unity Editor doesn't correctly import navmeshes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2018/10/12 | None                                                                                                   | Manually regenerate the navmesh after opening the project.            |
