# SpatialOS GDK for Unity known issues

Known issue = any major user-facing bug or lack of user-facing feature that:
1. diverges from vanilla Unity ECS design or implementation **OR**
1. diverges from user expectations from a SpatialOS project (e.g. interacting across worker boundaries)

| Issue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Date added | Unity Ticket                                                                                           | Workaround?                                                           |

| The Unity Editor doesn't correctly import navmeshes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2018/10/12 | None                                                                                                   | Manually regenerate the navmesh after opening the project.            |
| Running a worker that has been built using IL2CPP leads to a crash. This is due to [a bug in Unity](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-notsupportedexception-is-thrown-when-using-system-dot-type-dot-getcustomattributes-type-bool).                                                                                                         | 2019/01/28 | None                                                                                                | Use the Mono compiler. There is no workaround for iOS.                                                |
| Running the FPS project in the Editor with the current platform as Android leads to the walls being slightly transparent.                                                                                                      | 2019/01/28 | None                                                                                                | It renders correctly when running in the Emulator or an Android device                                                |
| Building a worker in the FPS starter project for Linux will throw errors when compiling the 'Hidden/PostProcessing/FinalPass' shader.                                                                                                    | 2019/01/28 | None                                                                                                | The build still succeeds and won't affect your worker.                                                |
| Protocol logging on Linux workers is disabled due to a libcpp linking bug in Unity.                                                                                                   | 2019/01/28 | None                                                                                                | No workaround.                                                |
