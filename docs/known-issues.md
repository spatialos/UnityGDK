| The Unity Editor doesn't correctly import NavMeshes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2018/10/12 | None                                                                                                   | Manually regenerate the NavMesh after opening your project.            |
| Running the FPS Starter Project in the Unity Editor with the current platform as Android leads to the walls being slightly transparent.                                                                                                      | 2019/01/28 | None                                                                                                | It renders correctly when running in the Emulator or an Android device                                                |
| Building a worker in the FPS Starter Project for Linux will throw errors when compiling the `Hidden/PostProcessing/FinalPass` shader.                                                                                                    | 2019/01/28 | None                                                                                                | The build still succeeds and won't affect your worker.                                                |
