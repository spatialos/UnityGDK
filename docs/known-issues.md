# SpatialOS GDK for Unity known issues

Known issue = any major user-facing bug or lack of user-facing feature that:
1. diverges from vanilla Unity ECS design or implementation **OR**
1. diverges from user expectations from a SpatialOS project (e.g. interacting across worker boundaries)

| The Unity Editor randomly crashes on MacOS when using ECS preview packages. This is not caused by the SpatialOS GDK.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2018/07/25 | 1064084                                                                                                | Simply retry.                                                         | No     |
| IL2CPP does not currently work on Mac as it crashes upon starting the game. This is due to a bug in Unity that does not initialize a system correctly, if one of the injected `IComponentData` contains a `long`.                                                                                                            | 2018/08/31 | 1076596                                                                                                | Use the Mono compiler.                                                | Yes    |
| `bool` is not a [blittable type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/blittable-and-non-blittable-types), so will cause an error if used to store component data.                                                                                                                                       | 2018/09/17 | None                                                                                                   | Use `BlittableBool` instead.                                          | No     |
| Accessing component data from an entity query will segfault, therefore requests where `ResultType` is `SnapshotResultType` will be dropped before sending.                                                                                                                                                                   | 2018/09/19 | None                                                                                                   | Don't send entity queries where `ResultType` is `SnapshotResultType`. | No     |
| There is a bug in the preview version of the [High Definition Render Pipeline (Unity Blog)](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/03/16/the-high-definition-render-pipeline-focused-on-visual-quality/), where shaders do not fully compile and appear visually darker than intended.                                               | 2018/10/12 | [566245](https://forum.unity.com/threads/shadergraph-subgraph-importing-bug-on-shared-project.566245/) | Manually reimport shaders.                                            | No     |
| The Unity Editor doesn't correctly import navmeshes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2018/10/12 | None                                                                                                   | Manually regenerate the navmesh after opening the project.            | No     |
