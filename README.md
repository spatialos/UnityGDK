# The SpatialOS Unity GDK readme (pre-alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS and Unity GDK community. 

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the Unity GDK, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SCZTCYm) or talk to us on the *feedback* section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the *unity-gdk tag* - this [link](https://forums.improbable.io/latest?tags=unity-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag).

#### What's the Unity GDK all about?
The Unity Game Development Kit (GDK) enables game developers to build multiplayer games with SpatialOS. It will be made up of three parts: 

* the GDK Core, a performant, data-driven [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos) multiplayer integration based on the new Unity [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS).

* a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems via Feature Modules.

* the example game, which both tests and demonstrates the Feature Modules; for use as a starting point or resource for game development.

In the future you will be able to use the Unity GDK to make multiplayer games with [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos). This is a pre-alpha release of the GDK Core which is the foundation of the product. To find out more see the [Unity GDK blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/unity-gdk-our-first-steps).

## Recommended use

This pre-alpha version software and its documentation is, by its very nature, rough and ready; every part of it is subject to change, including the APIs, and it isn’t optimised for performance. In addition, the GDK is based on Unity’s experimental [Entity Component System and Job System](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS).

This release is for evaluation and feedback only, with limited documentation; we aren’t supporting any game development on the pre-alpha version of the Unity GDK. 

**Who is it for?**

This pre-alpha release is for experienced Unity developers who have some understanding of [SpatialOS concepts](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos), are interested in Unity's [Entity Component System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/Documentation/index.md), and want to give early feedback.
