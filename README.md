# The SpatialOS GDK for Unity readme (alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS GDK for Unity community.

Our SpatialOS community shapes the functionality of the SpatialOS GDK for Unity, so make sure you are part of the conversation. Come and find us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/SCZTCYm) or talk to us on the *feedback* section in our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/) (use the *unity-gdk tag* - this [link](https://forums.improbable.io/latest?tags=unity-gdk) takes you there and pre-fills the category and tag).

#### What's the SpatialOS GDK for Unity all about?
The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unity enables game developers to build multiplayer games with SpatialOS. It will be made up of three parts:

* the GDK Core, a performant, data-driven [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos) multiplayer integration based on the new Unity [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS).

* a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems via Feature Modules.

* the example game, which both tests and demonstrates the Feature Modules; for use as a starting point or resource for game development.

For further high-level information about this, see the [summary of key features](docs/content/faqs/key-features.md).

In the future, you will be able to use the GDK to make multiplayer games with [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos). This is a alpha release of the GDK Core which is the foundation of the product. To find out more see the [GDK blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/unity-gdk-our-first-steps).

## Recommended use

This alpha version software and its documentation is, by its very nature, rough and ready; every part of it is subject to change, including the APIs, and it isn’t optimised for performance. In addition, the GDK is based on Unity’s experimental [Entity Component System and Job System](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS).

This release is for evaluation and feedback only, with limited documentation; we aren’t supporting any game development on the alpha version of the GDK.

**Who is it for?**

This alpha release is for experienced Unity developers who have some understanding of [SpatialOS concepts](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos), are interested in Unity's [Entity Component System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/Documentation/index.md), and want to give early feedback.
