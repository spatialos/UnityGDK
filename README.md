# The SpatialOS GDK for Unity (alpha)

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unity enables game developers to build multiplayer [Unity](http://unity3d.com) games with [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos). It will be made up of three parts:

* the GDK Core, a performant, data-driven [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos) multiplayer integration.

* a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems via Feature Modules.

* the example game, which both tests and demonstrates the Feature Modules; for use as a starting point or resource for game development.

For further high-level information about this, see the [summary of key features](docs/content/faqs/key-features.md).

This is an alpha release of the GDK Core which is the foundation of the product. To find out more see the [GDK blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/unity-gdk-our-first-steps).

## Recommended use

This alpha release is for experienced Unity developers who have some understanding of [SpatialOS concepts](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos), and want to give early feedback.

This alpha version software and its documentation is, by its very nature, rough and ready; every part of it is subject to change, including the APIs, and it isn’t optimised for performance. In addition, the GDK is based on Unity’s experimental [Entity Component System and Job System](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS).

This release is for evaluation and feedback only, with limited documentation; we aren’t supporting any game development yet.

## Support policy
We are not supporting the alpha release for game development, as this version is for evaluation only. However, please do give us your feedback.

## Migration from the SpatialOS Unity SDK
