# The SpatialOS Unity GDK readme (pre-alpha)

The Unity Game Development Kit (GDK) enables developers to build multiplayer games with SpatialOS. It will be made up of three parts: 

* the GDK Core, a performant, data-driven [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos) multiplayer integration based on the new Unity [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS).

* a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems via Feature Modules.

* the example game, which both tests and demonstrates the Feature Modules; for use as a starting point or resource for game development.

In the future you will be able to use the Unity GDK to make multiplayer games with [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and [SpatialOS](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/concepts/spatialos). This is a pre-alpha release of the GDK Core which is the foundation of the product. To find out more see the [Unity GDK blogpost](https://improbable.io/games/blog/unity-gdk-our-first-steps).

## Recommended use

This pre-alpha version software and its documentation is, by its very nature, rough and ready; every part of it is subject to change, including the APIs, and it isn’t optimised for performance. In addition, the GDK is based on Unity’s experimental [Entity Component System and Job System](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/job-system-ECS). Currently it's Windows only but later releases will also support MacOS.

This release is for evaluation and feedback only, with limited documentation; we aren’t supporting any game development on the pre-alpha version of the Unity GDK. 

**Who is it for?**

This pre-alpha release is for experienced Unity developers who have some understanding of [SpatialOS concepts](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/13.0/shared/concepts/spatialos), are interested in Unity's [Entity Component System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/blob/master/Documentation/index.md), and want to give early feedback.
