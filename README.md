The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unity allows you to quickly and easily build and host Unity multiplayer games. These games can use multiple server-side game engines across one seamless world to create new kinds of gameplay.

If you're a Unity game developer and ready to try out the GDK, follow the [Get started guide](https://docs.improbable.io/unity/alpha/projects/fps/get-started/get-started).

> The SpatialOS GDK for Unity is in alpha. We are committed to rapid development of the GDK to improve stability, usability, and performance - for information on this, see our [development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity/projects/1) and contact us via our [forums](https://forums.improbable.io/latest?tags=unity-gdk), or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SCZTCYm). Sign up to our [mailing list](http://go.pardot.com/l/169082/2018-06-25/27mhsb) to get updates about the GDK for Unity.

## Developing on the GDK

We recommend that you start developing with the [**Blank Starter Project**](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-blank-project) or the [**First Person Shooter (FPS) Starter Project**](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity-fps-starter-project/).

If you'd like to develop on this repository, there is a little bit of additional setup:

### Developer dependencies

In addition to the dependencies listed [here](https://docs.improbable.io/unity/alpha/machine-setup#4-install-the-gdk-dependencies), you will need the following programs present on your `PATH`:

* [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

### Setup

1. Checkout this repository.
2. Run `init.sh` or `init.ps1` to download the dependencies.
3. Open the Unity project in `workers/unity`.

> **Why do I need to hit init?**
> 
> As of [release 0.2.5](https://github.com/spatialos/gdk-for-unity/releases/tag/0.2.5), we publish the dependencies as UPM (NPM) packages. This repository contains the source for these packages, but dependencies such as the Worker SDK and schema standard library are not committed to the repository. `init.sh`/`init.ps1` downloads these dependencies and puts them in the correct place.
>
> If you fail to run `init.sh`/`init.ps1` before opening Unity, Unity _will_ delete the `.meta` files associated with the files downloaded by `init.sh`/`init.ps1`. If this happens to you, run `git reset --hard` to reset the repostory back to a good state. Note that this is a destructive `git` operation, so any un-committed changes will be lost.
